Majili,"Love this movie! The story was simple, but was portrayed beautifully. The performances were brilliant and it reminded me of old movies, filled with simplicity throughout. Though it was a long one, never felt bored, definitely a heart winner!",5
Majili,This will become chay career best acting and same Samantha terrific performance loved all technical stuff and cinematography and direction was emotional even Divyansha is perfect to her role overall a emotional and true life film,5
Majili,"Superb acting from naga chaitanya and samantha.
Awesome story.",5
Majili,"Awesome story...... A beautiful and different love emotional family story .......its a great story ,every one rocking in the movie,especially naga chaitanys acting improved compared in past ..finally its pure love story going to a big blockbuster movie",5
Majili,"Actually I saw the rating of movie first and then I watched it, hoping it's great, but in reality it's kind of different, the first half was not great it was closed without any proper ending, the chemistry between both the nag and first heroine was completely different from what he gives after love failure, mainly there was no intense feeling and the ending of the movie was even not great I feel it couldn't drag me or any in the theatre to connect to it the way they presented.I probably don't Suggest a second visit",3
Majili,Majili movie is really emotional movie with a dialogues chaitu and divyanksha lived in the acting and shiva nirvaran dialogues and screen play makes the film good,5
Majili,"Majili is probably one of the good performances of Nag Chaitanya,not the best. Samantha did a phenomenal job and protrayed sravani role in a good way. The first half entirely focused on Love story between Chat and Divyansha(She looks beautiful) ,but there is nothing new in that story. We already seen that and been there ,but I didn't felt bored ,thanks to the new face (Divyansha) and songs composed by Gopi Sundar were one of the assets for this movie. Second half , here Chay-Sam factor worked big time and Background score by Thaman was beautiful. Director Shiva nirvana did a good job and his dialogues were good. Suhas as chay friend was good .
Though there are some few flaws in story , majili is a decent watch.",4
Majili,Chaitu acting is wonderful and divyanksha and samantha looks beautiful so movie became a wonderful hit,5
Majili,Chaitu did hia job excellent no other hero did this so it looks like fantastic movie he gave to fans a memorable hit,5
Majili,"An alcoholic and a failed cricketer, Poorna is a nuisance in his neighbourhood, burden for his father and a wound that needs to be nursed for his wife. His wound runs deep as its not physical, but an emotional trauma caused by a love story which changes him forever.
Love, heartbreak and cricket is the premise around which Shiva Nirvana builds his latest love story Majili. He builds his characters slowly around this, but for the large part of the film, there's a lot of heartbreak and less love, while cricket is simply shown as an aside - most of it is exaggerated and flawed. Strangely enough, for a love story like Majili, there are a lot of action sequences. It seems people in Vizag, where the film is based, are willing to beat each other up at the drop of a hat. And there's seldom any closure to all the violence. It all seemed part of a mythical 'magic formula' that the director was trying to find. And yet, despite all of this, Majili keeps you interested and entertained for most part of it.",4
Majili,"One of the best in recent times .
Love in it's best form",5
Majili,I don't understand how this film has such high rating.Very pathetic extremely disappointed.V bad story line!!! Please don't waste your time watching this film!!,1
Majili,I felt bored and predictable from Dehradun episode to climax.... Samantha expressions are irritating I think the love story shown in this film is painful and happens in real life too but the married life of the hero is dramatic and missing logic in few scenes but the climax is impressive and melting,3
Shazam!,"They must have superhero fatigue. Why? This movie is at the very least comparable to every other. Here's what this movie has:First, a lot of really genuinely good comedy. You aren't going to laugh at dirty jokes, you aren't going to laugh at corny jokes, you're going to laugh at genuinely well written and performed comedy. In fact, probably soon to be one of the most iconic comedic moments in superhero movies to date with Shazam and his foe.Second, this movie has more than one cameo. The entire team did a great job of keeping a secret cameo (and it's not the one that people might think of at the very end).Third, this has such a great portrayal of Foster families. Very often movies have these really negative, terrible portrayals of Foster kids and the families they go into. The family that Billy gets into genuinely care about each other. It's easy to see why Billy would want to accept them. Especially after you find out some information which I will not reveal here.One common criticism is that this movie forces drama between the comedic parts and that it doesn't work well. This is only somewhat true. The drama is believable, but it's a little forced, but let me play devil's advocate. We have gotten very used to incredibly great dramas, but not every movie can have this. It's a superhero movie. In all honesty, the drama in most superhero movies always comes second. It is never really THAT captivating. This shouldn't be held up to the standard of great dramas films. Really, no superhero movie should. With that being said, I find the motivation for the villain to be persuasive. Imagine that you are a child that is being bullied. Typically if you cannot rely on your family and friends to help, you're going to probably grow up with anger in your heart. In this case, he has no friends and his family ARE the bullies. Someone criticized this, but they're completely wrong. That's a strong motivation to be someone who wants to take his anger out on others (especially family).Another thing I love about this movie is that Billy is never really just motivated to start doing good. He shows that he is willing to do good. He protects Freddy from being beat up, but only when it's gone too far. He's chosen by the Wizard not because he is some perfect, good-hearted child, but because he has the potential to be exactly that. The fact that he's willing to protect Freddy from bullies and that he gets his powers, then doesn't immediately start to save everyone shows the writers knew exactly what they were doing. This isn't some shortcut to being a good person. It doesn't show that he does all of the very funny things he does just to.make the audience last. He's learning. He's still not perfect. It's only when he has to save people from a problem that he created that he even remotely starts to start trying to understand the responsibility he carries. It's not until he begins to accept his foster family as his real family does he really understand the importance of helping others. You have to remember that he's always been a loner. He's never really experienced love since.. well, you'll see, but NEVER. In fact, I don't even think he's fully understood by the end of the movie. He's still learning. And why wouldn't he be? He's only 14.
This movie is absolutely great. It's much more than okay. It's honestly better than most comic book movies I've seen in awhile, but for different reasons than the other traditional superhero movies (like I said, this movie has those traditional elements, but also much more). The only way that it is ""just okay"" is if you have some serious superhero fatigue.",5
Shazam!,"Seriously can't believe how much I loved this movie! This felt like a proper superhero movie felt when I was a kid, they captured the perfect tone, can't fault it.",5
Shazam!,"I am quite disappointed that some of you guys felt that this movie is not even worth 1 star. How is it possible ? Seriously to me is very funny throughout the movie. This movie also suits family to watch together. Even though the story line is NOT as strong as other movie, but hey, the hilarious part makes this movie very interesting and NOT dull at all. Very RARE to see a super hero behaving in a comedy way...lol. Conclusion, worth to go watch at movie theater ! 10/10",5
Shazam!,"I got to see an early screening of Shazam! at my local theater, and boy did it not disappoint. It's not flawless, but the good outweighs the bad more often than not. With a bright story, boundless energy, and an irresistible sense of fun, this is certainly one of the best-if not the best-installment of the DCEU so far.Direction: I feel like David Samberg is the DCEU's Taika Waititi. He's this movie director that really isn't known for much past some horror, which made him an initially odd choice for this movie; a choice that paid off tremendously. He helps some light shine into this world, but doesn't underplay the action. His direction and coordination through framing helps us laugh and, in some cases, feel the punches. The action isn't jolty like the other DCEU installments and due to the bright vibrant colors, we really know what's happening, where it's happening, and who it's happening to. Well done.The writing was uneven, but definitely fun. It's a basic story that converts Billy Batson's origin into a modern-day retelling with some elements of Big in there. The humor is well-timed and consistently funny; a lot of meta jokes and inner humor help the story obtain its brighter feel. The relationships written in are heartfelt and the story itself has a lot of heart. One part that causes a rift is the central character of Billy. His two versions, between the adult and the kid, seem to be two completely different people. It's an inconsistency that's fine being just about the only part (besides typical villain problems) that bugs you about the writing.Performances: I swear, Zachary Levi was born to play Shazam! He carries childlike enthusiasm and a heart in effortlessly. He oozes charisma and really... I won't be able to say it enough so here it is: Zachary Levi is perfection. The rest... Kid Billy was somewhat toned down but still played quite nicely. Mark Strong played a menacing villain. The child actors, especially Jack Dylan Fraiser (Grazer? I'm sorry I don't remember off the top of my head), were VERY good. Child actors really are improving. Any other supporting performance was played nicely and everyone knew who the real star of the movie was: I'm sorry, I'm gonna keep coming back to this: Zachary Levi is a national treasure.What else... music was nice and heartfelt, I talked about the action sequences... every other part of this film is mainly there to add to Billy's story and I like it. The world is undeniably fun and we're not really pulled out of it.The future is bright for the DCEU with chapters like Shazam! (9/10)",5
Shazam!,"It was pretty much exactly what I expected which is a really enjoyable and lighthearted superhero film with some funny moments and that will be enough for most people but it just didn't blow me away. No way this is a 10 like some are suggesting and to nitpick, adult Billy acts nothing like young Billy at all. Don't get me wrong - its still a fun movie which I can recommend.",4
Shazam!,"I went into this a little sceptical and found I came out rather chuffed with such a good film. Far far better than I was expecting and pleased I had gone to a preview screener for this.The acting is spot on, the comedy is spot on and the action is.... You guessed it, spot on. I certainly recommend any super hero fan to go watch this and big praised to WB for leaving this alone and letting the DIrector get on with it.",5
Shazam!,Awesome show last night. The whole cast did an excellent job.,5
Shazam!,"This movie is just perfect in every way and very different compared to other superhero films. Trailers barely show anything. There are so many surprises (no, I'm not just talking about some little cameo, I'm talking about main stuff). Also if you feel that most superhero films are showing similar stuff and want something new then this is for you and those who enjoy every superhero films anyway then it's definitely for you. And even those who don't like superhero films at all, will also love it.",5
Shazam!,"I saw the trailer and I thought- genius a superhero that's actually a kid!
Think, Tom Hanks' ""Big"" meets Superman (1978).
I remember liking Shazam as a kid in the 80's (it took me a long time to call him Capt Marvel) but not much else I remember.
So I watched the 1940's serial & was impressed, so I watched the 1970's tv show and although cheesy was entertaining, so I moved onto the 1980's filmation series and fell in love with that.
This renaissance I had with Shazam only happened 5 months ago too!
Shazam! (2019) has all that 40's/70's/80's elements mixed together.
The bad guys look awesome, the movie has lots of laughs and tons of heart.
One bad thing: there is 1 short scene (parent scene) that gets too dark - it made me feel uncomfortable...it kinda pulled me out of the movie but thank god it's a short scene cuz this is one of my favorite comic book movies ever.
1. Batman 1989
2. Dark Knight
3. Superman 2
4. CA Civil War
5. Shazam!",5
Shazam!,"Shazam was more enjoyable than I thought it would be. If you either a comic book fan or not regardless you will enjoy it from start to end. Although Shazam doesn't contain as much fighting scenes you would see in movies these days it still leaves you with a fully polished story and character development. Shazam shows a teenage kid that gets powers and what he uses it for and obviously its typical things teenage kids would do. If you are plotting on whether or not to go, the obvious answer is YES!",5
Shazam!,Joyous fun from beginning to end. Kudos to Zachary Levi for his superb portrayal of a childish superhero.,5
Shazam!,"Im not really a fan of DC, but damn! This whole movie had me laughing and smiling, fight scenes and cgi was great, I now wanna watch it again. Please watch if you haven't.",5
Shazam!,DC smashed it again. Unlike Man of Steel and Batman v Superman bright and fun.,5
Shazam!,"I've gotten tired of the super-heroes that are arrogant rich guys (Iron Man), arrogant jokers (Deadpool) or the ones that get handed ultimate powers and don't appreciate people below them (Captain Marvel). So I went into this movie hoping simply for a comedy, but was pleasantly surprised to see the character grow through the story to value wholesome ideals. My son said it wasn't realistic to always expect a superhero to be good all the time, but I think that is the point of a superhero movie. If I wanted to see a movie where the character didn't grow to be a better person, then I could just watch the world around me.This might not be the superhero that people want, but it's the one they need.",5
Shazam!,"I first heard about this movie from a trailer in the cinema while waiting impatiently for Captain Marvel. In that moment I thought to myself ""one superhero movie I don't want to watch"". I don't consider myself DC or Marvel but this movie definitely left a mark on me.Such a heart warming story; there were a few scenes that made it hard not to hold tears and if I were watching alone I'd probably be wailing. Character development could have been done better, like the power transfer scene I feel was a bit rushed. It's not a flawless movie but, I haven't felt this way about recent movies since Star Wars: The Last Jedi which is why I even took the time to write this review, something I don't usually bother to do. Hence why I give it 10/10, because it made me feel.Oh did I mention there was amazing comedy? I laughed hysterically at Mr. Moran; the jokes made were really well thought out and there wasn't any of the vulgar ones (or if they were probably minimal) which goes to show that you can have an amazing comedy without having to resort to it (I like you a lot Deadpool but, this one takes the cake).",5
Shazam!,"Just came out from the theatre and believe me it's best dc movie till now zachary acting was the best thing of the movie,Dceu Is On Fire Superman Cameo Was Best Thing In The Movie",5
Shazam!,The Film Is purely amazing and Zachary Levi born for The Role 100%,5
Shazam!,"A movie that you can easily take the whole family! It offers a combination of suspense, action, and comedy in a way that young and old can enjoy! The story is told from a kid's perspective, because the super hero is young teenager turned super hero. The cool thing about this movie is as he learns his super power, it is filled with comedy and action. He also learns how to trust the people around him - his new family. So, if you like a story that will uplift your spirits, then go see this movie. So, far this is by far the best movie of the year. Go see it today - will enjoy it from start to finish!!!",5
Shazam!,"Great movie, another perspective of superhero, superhero with magic",5
Shazam!,"The movie was fun. A movie don't have to be dark or have some kind of deep meaning to be perfect. The story was simple, lots of gags, cgi were awesome, And perfectly balanced.",5
Shazam!,I never cared and never like any recent superhero movie. Cause i already know it's just war vs war vs overused CGI. Nothing will last in my mind after a week past watching. But this movie is something i used to love from a superhero movies/story.,5
Hellboy,"Yet another big blockbuster action movie based on a comic is the base of Hellboy. A few people had mentioned this movie before it came out and reassured me it would be good, but it was the opposite. If you enjoy the comic books or are a fan of action and science fiction, you might even enjoy this movie. If you're not stay away. Could have been better. Decent acting, Good effects but very lousy story. Nevertheless, they were still entertaining !!",4
Hellboy,"I strongly urge anyone that considers themselves a fan of #Hellboy, the comics, the characters and not just the #GuillermodelToro/#RonPerlman films, please go see this film. This is a very different take on these iconic characters and the world they inhabit and it is the most fun version that I've seen so far. Don't get me wrong, I loved GDT's films, the man crafts beautiful modern fairly tales and this film was smart no to try and replicate that. Instead, this movie has more in common with #SamRaimi's #ArmyOfDarkness, over the top violence and Gore, not for those with a weak stomach, and frequent profanity. #DavidHarbour does an excellent job and plays the role very differently than Perlman did and it has the potential to propel him from TV into a full time movie star. #IanMcShane brings his usual gravitas and presence to the role previously embodied by the late great #JohnHurt, again being smart to not emulate that performance and make this role entirely his own.I feel like this movie is suffering from the same disconnect and out of touch effect that critics had with last year's #Venom. Critics almost universally panned that film while audiences similarly loved it. Every negative review I've read for this so far continually compares it unfavorably to the previous films and many also take issues with the excessive use of violence, Gore and adult language. What did you expect, this is an R Rated film and is thoroughly advertised as such.I hope positive word of mouth from fans makes this successful as they set up some very cool stuff for a potential sequel.If you love these characters like I do, if you love balls to the wall, over the top action horror, please see this film.",4
Hellboy,"Not your typical superhero comic. But really entertaining me throughout the end. Gory, dark humour, sassy hellboy. Fists and fights, not much of cheesy lines. I love it!",5
Hellboy,"I love the Hellboy comics, the novels, the short stories, all of it. Hands down my favorite comic book character ever written, and not likely to change.They got a few things right, fair credit where its due. The Hellboy in Mexico story was spot on and well done, Daimio and Gruagach were both fairly accurate, and the Baba Yaga's chicken leg house was just about perfect. They NAILED the Osiris Club and the Wild Hunt, which got a huge smile from me.But... Man, the rest of it? Why is Hellboy suddenly at odds with the Professor, who is suddenly a foul-mouthed monster hunter? Why rewrite the details to the origin? Why so dramatically change Alice?The sad fact is that this movie tried to do WAY too much in adapting The Storm and the Fury, which is essentially the climax of the entire Hellboy saga. There are too many moving pieces to that story, too many callbacks to previous stories, and truthfully its way too big a scope to try and cram into one story, even if the script and director were up to the challenge. And unfortunately they were not. The story is all over the place and rushed, the dialogue is really hackneyed in spots, and overall it just ends up a mess.David Harbour really does a great job in making Hellboy his own take on the character, but the script does him no favors in giving him very little room to work. If They ever make another, I do hope they bring him back, because it's clear how much he cares about the character.",2
Hellboy,"The new Hellboy was a helluva good time. Yes, it's different from the previous two films. But give it a chance. Harbour does a fantastic job as Hellboy. And the movie draws far more on the source/comic material than the previous films. If you loved the comics, you'll enjoy this movie. Plenty of humor, action, and fantasy to hold your interest.",5
Hellboy,Yup the movie is dumb but that's hellboy. The cgi and monsters are nice. Alot of action not much talking. I was entertained.,4
Hellboy,"Although the effort of the director and the talent of the actors, the movie lacks the charm of the Guillermo del Toro duology. The movie is way more faithful to the comics but it also tries to be faithful to the previous movies (which every reboot should try to be) but it just becomes a mess of attempts.
The CGI is overused- WHEN WILL STUDIOS LEARN!- and although the creatures design is very interesting, pretty much every character lacks the dept the old duology provided.
At the end of the day Hellboy(2019) is just another failed reboot that tries to be it's own thing while respecting the previous movies.
My rating?
5 out of 10, but I do agree with the 61% rating on rotten tomatoes because the movie isn't all crap, there's a charm to it but it's not enough to make you overlook it's flaws.
Just watch the Guillermo del Toro duology, it's a far superior franchise, and I would of loved to see the third movie if the studios didn't cancelled it.
If you are interested in the director Neill Marshall (which despite the failed attempt of rebooting Hellboy is a damn good director) go watch Dog Soldiers which is criminally underrated.
See you next time at the movies,
Ruben the Critic",3
Hellboy,"I don't know what the other reviewers take on this but I really do enjoy the movie. Eventhough the storyline sucks but the movies goes with the flow. For the Actions and Bloods lovers, I'm sure you guys will enjoy this. Really a action packed new Hellboy to a newer generations",5
Hellboy,"I don't understand the hate for this movie. Because of all the bad reviews I went into this thinking it was going to be horrible, but it's wasn't at all. Is it an Oscar winner? No! But not every movie has to be. I really enjoyed it and had a good time. A lot of the humor landed with me and the audience I was watching with. The gore was a BIT much, so know going into it that there are some pretty horrific scenes. David really shone as HellBoy. Overall a good movie!",5
Hellboy,Just because Del Toro isnt directing and Hellboy isnt Perlman doesnt mean this film should be getting slammed unfairly the way it is. it's a new vision and adaptation that actually works even better as far as following comic source material. The action and pacing is intense and the horror aspects are really well blended. People keep slandering the cgi and honestly its excellent cgi. The story blends many different particular comics together and it works. David Harbor gives a lot of great character to hellboy as well. Just see this and pay no mind to delusional biased critics and haters. It's a fun adaptation.,5
Hellboy,I think the fact that everyone started slating this movie from its announcement hasnt helped it. Much more faithful to the graphic novels. No soppy love story. Just action!,5
Hellboy,The movie is really good and the actors tried their best for brining their character to life,5
Hellboy,"Now I never really write reviews for anything. But with all the bad reviews this has been getting I felt the need to come to it's defence.This film is actually fantastic.
So first off, STOP COMPARING THIS TO DEL TOROS WORK. Del Toro did not invent hellboy. He simply adapted the source material with his own spin. Don't get me wrong, I love the orginal two...BUT, all these negative reviews by people who are determined to hate it because of the Del toro movies is downright childish to be quite honest.Second, Harbour does a bloody fantastic job of bringing hellboy to life. While still not exactly the same as the comic hellboy, his damn close, way more so than Ron Perlmen.Now as a longstanding mega fan of the comics I can safely say this was made for the fans. It has so many utterly satisfying scenes, nods, characters and scenarios, subtle and not so subtle ripped straight from the comics. So if you're a fan of the comics , you will get that little extra bit of satsifaction.I was thoroughly entertained as both a fan and a movie goer.
If you dont go in expecting a oscar winning masterpiece. You're in a for one incredibly entertaining, gore filled, epic quest of a movie. Filled with silly humour, epic fights, actually good cgi and more monster than you can shake a big red fist at.Don't listen to the hate..GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",5
Hellboy,"I read the comics and watched the other hellboy films including animated films, truly I love hellboy and I don't care if anyone is giving hellboy 2019 bad ratings",5
Hellboy,"Currently being slammed by critics and sitting a very low score on rotten tomatoes, Hell Boy is a film I went into with zero expectations.
I just wanted something silly, entertaining and over the top, and the exactly what I got, and I must say, I enjoyed the..erm..hell out of it.
Directed by Neil Marshal, who has worked on Game of thrones and West World, this is not the Neil Marshall who gave us the horror masterpiece that is The Decent.
This is the Neil Marshal who gave us Dog Soldiers and Doomsday.
Silly, gory, surprising and does not give a **** about embracing it absurd concept to the full. David Harbor knocks it out of the park as Hellboy, and one thing he has over Ron Perlman's performance is a sense of threat; that he really could be evil of pushed too far.
The whole film moves at a fast pace and has a feel of a video game, but here it works, with a mix of Devil May Cry and God of War, especially in the combat and design of some creatures.
Maybe I was in a forgiving mood but the Bebop like villain Gruagach had me in stiches with his sweary mouth and English northern accent.
Go see it if you want some outrageous fantasy violence and a few laughs.",4
Hellboy,"Really don't understand the hate. This movie is funny, and entertaining through and through. I loved it. A lot better than DelToro's version. Go see it, have a good time and don't go in expecting to hate it. It's actually a pretty solid movie. I mean cmon, it's hellboy, what do you want?",5
Hellboy,"I really like Hellboy, and liked this movie a lot. I also liked the Del Toro movies, but this movie is more similar to the comics. It has fun action and I enjoyed the ride. CGI wasn't great, but I didn't bother me too much.",5
Hellboy,"On par with Ron pearlman hellboy. Fantastical monsters, good humour, great special effects. Well worth a look.",4
Hellboy,"This film is great, from the CGI, to the blood guts and humour. So many people are going into this movie with the intent of disliking it that they don't give it a chance and it's just immature",5
Hellboy,"I love Hellboy, the first film I remember watching was the original Hellboy. I grew up on Hellboy and of course it was hard to exit from Del Toro and Pearlman's shadow as their movies were amazing. Now I feel Hellboy has grown with me as now I enjoy the excessive gore. Of course this movie wasn't perfect my main problems being a reasonably weak villain and the lack of build up with Professor Broom and Hellboy relationship but a things considered it was still an enjoyable movie that I will watch again and pray that it earns a sequel.",4
Hellboy,"I saw ""Hellboy"", starring David Harbour-Stranger Things_tv, Suicide Squad; Milla Jovovich-the Resident Evil movies, Dazed and Confused; Ian McShane-the John Wick movies, We Are Marshall and Daniel Dae Kim-Hawaii Five_O_tv, Lost_tv.
This is a reboot of the Hellboy series-not number 3 in a trilogy of the 2004 & 2008 movies-with David taking over the title role. They do touch on his origin story a little, but not too heavily. It's based on the graphic novels by Mike Mignola and focuses more on the supernatural elements of the character and not so much on the super hero ones. Milla plays the Blood Queen, an ancient sorceress wanting to remake the world for demons-she also wants Hellboy/David as her King. Ian plays the man that adopted David and raised him and tried to instill good qualities into him. Daniel plays an agent for the B.P.R.D.-the good guy's organization they work for that fights evil-and Daniel has secrets of his own. The creatures throughout the film all look creative-they don't always look like what you normally see. If you are familiar with the books-I'm not, but I like the movies-you probably know a character named Lobster Johnson. He shows up in sort of a cameo role and is portrayed by Thomas Haden Church. As the end credits start, there is a scene and then there is also one after the end credits.
It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence and gore and language and has a running time of 2 hours.
He's not my favorite super hero but I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",4
Hellboy,Absolute disaster! Terrible casting. Effects and costumes so inconceivably atrocious! Hard to comprehend how computer graphics can be so much inferior to the previous movies. Ron Perlman is the true Hellboy hands down.,2
Hellboy,"Sadly, for me the best thing about this movie is only first 2/3 minutes and CGI(Especially Character Design which looks creepy.)",4
Hellboy,"I don't consider myself an angry guy but if this is the new standard for blockbusters, Baba Yaga can have both my eyes because I will have no further use for them. There's nothing I can think of to defend this cinematographic abomination. This extremely ugly shot cosplay version of Mike Mignola's Hellboy comic does not even attempt to tell a coherent story. The soundtrack consists of some out of place rock songs that are stuck in random places in the film. Unlike Del Toro's films, there is no way of feeling any sympathy for the one-dimensional characters. The endless stream of silly one-liners and aimless quips make you realize that these annoyingly unpleasant characters have nothing to tell us over the course of two (!) excruciating hours. The movie simply jumps from exposition piece to action scene and back again. And where Guillermo Del Toro created a tactile world with a balanced combination of practical effects work and sparingly used CGI, we are now saddled with special effects that look like the deleted scenes from a Playstation 3 game. It's incomprehensible that Mignola believes that this soulless version is closer to the comics. I think the claim that the a fan of the source material would be at peace with this terrible movie is an insult.",1
Hellboy,"There's a lot of people comparing this movie to the del Toro and Pearlman's Hellboy and sequels, this is NOT that movie. And there's a lot of people who are probably angry that this is not del Toro's 'Hellboy 3'.
This film is really good. It's VERY faithful to the comics. And it is METAL! Extremely metal. This most metal movie I have seen. And it isn't watered down, nor is it apologetic. There is violence and gore, as there should be! This is Hellboy. Spawn suffered some due to censorship, but not this. Overall it was very enjoyable.
You are also going to have people complaining that this film is very violent. DUH! This movie is rated R for a reason. DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS UNDER 13!!! If they are 14 and older, use your best judgement. If you liked Dredd, you will like this.
This movie is not perfect. There are some issues concerning pacing. This is because they do use a LOT of content and do go through it very fast, and don't have time to really develop it. But, it doesn't hurt the movie nor does it make it any less enjoyable. Causal readers of the comic and hardcore fans will get the references, plots, and characters more than someone who's just a movie goer or who just watches super hero movies.
David Harbour does an excellent job as Hellboy. He really brings the character to life. It's different from Pearlman's, but, his Hellboy really sings of the one from the comics.
Their Baba Yaga is so freakin' sweet. Totally creepy, scary, and they don't pull punches. This is the Hellboy we've been missing.",4

The Tashkent Files,"I watched the movie, I got home, I read some ebooks about the tashkent case. The movie was right. Why was the truth hidden from us? It's a must watch to make people aware of the evils in the society.
The dialogues were the best part of the movie. Acting by Mithun day was awesome. I would appreciate it if the cinematography could have been improved. I hated some awkward camera angles. Otherwise it was a fantastic movie.

Enlighten your self as I did with movie
Must watch for history lovers",5
The Tashkent Files,"I was looking at several review before going to see this movie but i am amazed.All I can say those reviews are a bit biased against the film.A critic called the movie ""not factual"" , well its not directors fault at all,the movies was inspired by Anuj Dhar book who is a great author. critics may say its ""hysterics into history"" but at least Vivek has the courage to show what ""history"" is.The film is not perfect but it's not bad to be given 1 star review by some critics.",5
The Tashkent Files,"This movie not a boring political movie, this is a hair raising thriller. A must watch for everyone.",5

The Tashkent Files,It's an eye opener how politics in India was ran by main political party. They did what felt good to promote one family and destroyed every other achiever of India like Shastri Jee,5
The Tashkent Files,"This movie will just blow your mind. It's just not a movie its a history that Indians were misinformed about.
After watching this movie will get to know how a major political party carried out their evil deeds just to be the head of the nation.
The actual truth was coveredup by that political party just maintain their position.",5
The Tashkent Files,"The Tashkent FilesJust out of a special screening of #TheTashkentFiles. Produced by Pallavi Joshi and Vivek Agnihotri, the movie revolves around the mystery surrounding Lal Bahadur Shastri's death. It raises many questions and also provides accounts and documents regarding the mysterious death surrounding the second Prime Minister of India.If you loved Buddha in a Traffic Jam and felt Vivek Agnihotri was brutally honest and polticially incorrect in making that film, he goes one level up with The Tashkent Files and points fingers at even more powerful people and the ideology that drives them.A must watch for the present generation who have never read much on Lal Bahadur Shastri beyond the fact that he was the second Prime Minister of India, this docu drama brings out unpleasant questions of India's tryst with destiny - a destiny which seems to be on a cross roads once again as we head towards #LokSabha2019.And not just this, with Tashkent Files, the makers of the film also expose the magnitude with which the left eco system has systematically infiltrated multiple spheres of our life.I always wondered why could our film makers not come up with a movie revolving around the life and death of Shastri ji.Unfortunately based on his death, this movie does attempt to give us a glimpse of his life and the man that Shastri ji was. I will give it 5/5 to Vivek Agnihotri for having the courage to choose this theme to make a movie on.",5
The Tashkent Files,"THE TASHKENT FILES REVIEW :-
A MUCH NEEDED INTELLECTUAL MUST WATCH FILM IN BOLLYWOOD !How many of us knows that 2nd October is the Birth Anniversary of Lal Bahadur Shashtri as well? We call India as Country of Gandhiji and Nehruji, why not Shashtriji's? How strong was India's Position on Global Map when Lal Bahadur Shashtri was Prime Minister of India and how all of sudden India lost that strong position just after his mysterious death? These all are unsolved puzzles and we have had enough arguments and political propagandas over this, but Tashkent Files is just not about this, it is something more than that. It is about Secularism, socialism, terrorism, politics, our rights and bla bla but when all of these comes with a Great Cinematic Experience then believe me you just can't afford to miss this gem.The Tashkent Files deals with multiple issues at the same time keeping Shashtriji's death mystery at the center, rest phenomena of beneficial nature of people, types of terrorism, racism and the Fake Truth which has been accepted by our society etc. is created with Perfect mindset by the Writer and the Director Vivek Agnihotri. He finally comes out of his Adult Thrillers zome and delivers a Must See Experience. The entire cast does the justice to thier roles with thier own perfection. While Shweta Prasad showcases Best act of her career, Mithun Chakraborty, Mandira bedi and Pallavi Joshi stands out. Music was needless but there is one theme song ""Sab Chalta Hai"" which fails to impress, although Lyrics hits the Sharp aim on the subject. Dialogues are Knocky and you will utter 'Wow' for them at some occassions.At one moment, The Tashkent Files feels like Bollywood version of Hollywood Cult Classic '12 Angry Men' due to those Arguments and conference scenes but the motive was different here. Apart from unrevealed Facts on Shashtri, it also focuses on few political agendas and propagandas in thrilling mode. Overall, The Tashkent Files is much needed Intellectual Must Watch Film for Bollywood in this year and is certainly the Most Intelligent+Thinkable product of the year so far. One must have some brilliant knowledge of History to judge this film, and that's the reason why I am not sure whether to call it a Classic or not, hence rating is 7/10*",4

The Tashkent Files,Superhit movie.. bollywood should make movie like this.,5
The Tashkent Files,Nice movie with intriguing facts about the mystery surrounding the death of second prime minister of India shastriji..,5
The Tashkent Files,Absolutely brilliant movie. Book the first ticket you get and go...,5
The Tashkent Files,"Movie starts with questioning a case and ends up solving it but in a way where you'll be given the choice whether to end up believing things the way they are told to us or start investigating things yourself as the movie provides us with full source on where to look for more information. The whole point of this movie was to seek the truth.The way cast argued on some points really gave goosebumps as to how history can be so easily manipulated.It's a MUST WATCH as these movies don't generally end up in our movie theatres. ROMANCE, ACTION, DRAMA are good but Bollywood need these films to come out of the shell.",5
The Tashkent Files,"NDTV gave this 0.5 stars so you need to watch it , as simple as that .",5
The Tashkent Files,"Yet an other super bonanza of a movie from Bollywood.The movie attempts to shake up a strong and systematic construction of a possible cover up act surrounding the mysterious death of Shri Lal Bahadhur Shastri at Tashkent.The rocking of this edifice of possible lies unravels an ugly truth of mammoth proportions. Offcourse no one wants to hear it and no one wants to look at it , until it starts to stink really bad.The vehicle used to deliver the doubts is well constructed and dramatically engaging. It passes a shrill message of the current day politics and the political vendetta.The history lover in me does a disco dance of the entire presentation. The truth unfolds gradually and bulldozes the history books and refined it with questions that are valid.Seems our system is systematically corrupt and well used by Spies and intelligence agencies. Puppetry and puppets work well for a puppy show of politics. Seems The Iron Lady , The iron curtain and The irony of truth are all irrational.Must watch!!",5
The Tashkent Files,An eye opener to Shashtri's death controversies. Great acting and load more .. add this in must watch movie list.,5
The Tashkent Files,"A political thriller movie shows the real face of Indian politics. I wonder why Indian people never ask about India's second PM mysterious death. Salute to the makers who raise this issue with facts, Govt of India always try to hide these facts from common people. I'll recommend this movie for those who love history or having interest in Indian politics. Though this movie based on politics but still it's not boring or lousy movie, it won't allow you to even blink your eyes.",5
The Tashkent Files,Every Indian should watch this movie. We have been bound by the Tex book knowledge of schools provided by Congress. This movie is an eye opener for everyone. Great work by Vivek Agnihotri,5
The Tashkent Files,"TTF is not an attempt to pinpoint the culprit of an alleged assassination. It was the duty of the government of the day and they failed miserably in that. It's rather a quality political thriller, attempting to dig, correlate and create a picture of the circumstances in which Shastri Ji died. It showcases the important dialogues and discussions, which Indian public and agencies needed to have. There are thousands of questions unanswered and to the utter bewilderment, there are no signs of any serious attempt and enquiry or proof collected by government agencies on their PM's mysterious death. Vivek painstakingly crowd sourced and researched for 2 full years on the subject and is now ready to present before us the final picture. The movie was thrilling, captivating and constantly generated huge interest on the subject. Fact that the movie has one of the best cast line-up of recent times adds up a cherry to the whole thing. Enigmatic Mithun Da, conspiring Nasir, quizzing Pankaj Tripathi, menacing Pallivi Joshi and brilliant protagonist Shweta Basu Prasad alongwith other actors, assure a gripping thriller.I believe, this movie is sort of a reparation, however delayed, to the collective consciousness of this country and especially to that wife who wailed and cried to get justice and truth on her husband's mysterious death.The movie has to come out. We owe it to Shastri Ji.Go out, watch it, and make it a success!",5
Lucifer ,#SaveLucifer #PickUpLuciferOne of the best shows around. It deserves to continue right where it left off.,5
Lucifer ,As we all know by now FOX cancelled LUCIFER. I love that show. I hope and pray another network picks up LUCIFER. I think the best network to pick up LUCIFER is the CW. LUCIFER would fit right in the CW wheelhouse along with SUPERNATURAl and all the other shows like that the CW has. FOX which always cancels anything really good that people really like cancelled LUCIFER while leaving one hell of a cliffhanger.,5
Lucifer ,"Unfortunately I found out yesterday that Lucifer has been cancelled. As light hearted shows go it was a winner, the whole cast went for it and did a great job. Lucy, Maze, Douche, Amenadiel, and Linda were flawless in their roles. Perhaps Chloe could have removed the big wooden pole from her backside a bit more often but hey, she looked good. Its strange how good shows like this get chopped and absolute rubbish like IZombie keeps getting renewed and its really really rubbish.",5
Lucifer ,"How can you cancel the greatest show ever. In a world full of crap this was the only show that made me happy to watch. And Season 3 episode 24 was amazing. I am praying for being renewed. I am pretty sure that for so much money you can make up with good ideas. I understand that from now on it will be hard, but don't do the same as The Sicret Circle! Please! I give the show 10 out of 10!",5
Lucifer ,Are you kidding me! Why would they do. The show is great. They keep renewing these other shows that stinkLook at Timeless they canceled and the fans were outraged and they brought it back,5
Lucifer ,Lucifer is one of the best & most original show on TV. Please have another network pick it up. I will truly miss this show. I can't believe it was cancelled. What a shame. So much garbage out there & this gets cancelled. PLEASE BRING IT BACK.,5
Lucifer ,I can't believe this show has been cancelled already. It was FUNNY and WELL written.... although there were times I wish they'd hire more writers for this show because I loved the banter between Lucifer and the Detective (Chloe) that really showed us Lucifer wasn't as GOOD as he seemed.I loved that it seemed to follow some religious dogma and never lampooned it.Unfortunately this cancellation smells of Network giving in to the early protest by religious groups. If ONLY they had watched it... None of it made fun of religion or any one's beliefs!I am going to miss this show... I've watched hoping there'd be some reruns - I could watch this show So many times more!,5
Lucifer ,This has been one of our favorite shows on Monday nights! The season3 finale cannot be the series finale. Too many questions and answers given and need to know what's next! Tom Ellis is excellent as Lucifer.,5
Lucifer ,"I have liked this show from the beginning. Tom Ellis is perfect as the devil, and does an excellent job. The show has a lot to challenge the traditional; handsome, suave devil over an ugly one with horns. I love the line where he says something like, I'm tired of everyone blaming me for what they do, I didn't MAKE them do anything. There is a lot of truth delivered thru sophisticated humor and debonair acting. The Pierce/Cain story with Luci is intense at times, and you wonder if Cain will ever get the truth of how his curse will disappear. Note: just watched ep 20, he does. So...I love this show & want it to continue. Nielsen needs to fix their @*^&( rating system - I, & many like me, DO NOT WATCH TV - we watch whatever, whenever on the computer.",5
Lucifer ,"Lucifer is s show like no others.
It is drama, procedural, comedy, fantasy.
It 's full of funny lines and references to other shows/songs/movies
You have to be smart to keep up. 
The cast is awesome, Tom Ellis on top .
After 3 seasons, it was unexpectedly cancelled by Fox, leaving us wuth a huge cliffhanger and so many points to be covered.
The massive campaign #savelucifer #PickUpLucifer is sustaining the return of the show for a darker, powerful and supernatural season. 
 We hope to succeed to have our Devil back .
We deserve it",5
Lucifer ,"Great writing, excellent acting. Fun and unexpected, Lucifer has everything you need in a show.It was very sad and disappointing that the show was cancelled after just 3 seasons, there was certainly much more to offer the fans.I hope another network picks it.",5
Lucifer ,Hopefully this enjoyable show will be picked up by another network soon.,5
Lucifer ,"No doubt,It deserves to continue.It's fun,different,loved it.I see no reason to cancel.",5
Lucifer ,"You've got to be kidding me! This was one of the best shows on TV. I was even able to get some of my religious friends to watch it, and they found out their judgments were wrong!Tom Ellis is the best! He's handsome and funny as hell (pun intended) with LOL moments. I love the way he takes vanity to its highest level.Come on Fox network! Listen to the people who 'religiously ' LOL watch this show! Let us have some fun on a Monday night, after Sunday church. It's down right criminal to take this show off the air! Who are the executives who made this decision? Fire their asses! They are like stupid is as stupid does. Only way to solve the problem of bad timing for canceling a great show. You know what? I'm done with Fox! Won't be watching any of their shows. Waste of time, time I will never get back in life!",5
Lucifer ,"This show IS AWESOME!! This is one of the few network shows I have continued to watch. There must be a cable channel or Hulu, Netflix, or Amazon team willing to keep it alive. To be honest, ready to cancel one or two of the three aforementioned services do to lack of quality programming - and lack of quality movies. I would definitely continue to pay for a service that kept this series alive!",5
Lucifer ,"Exceptional writing, acting and character development! This series ended on a cliffhanger and Netflix needs to pick it up!",5
Lucifer ,"Lucifer is the best show that I have seen in a very long time. It has a perfect balance between humour and drama. From the description it may seem as just another cop show with a twist, but it is so much more. The true power of the show lies in the way it treats the characters. Never before have I seen a show that pays so much attention to character development. And it is not just the two main characters Lucifer & Chloe that grow througout the series, but also the other characters.The combination of the love that the creators have for all the characters with excellent storylines and dialogue sets this show apart from all others. This and the truly stellar acting makes that it absolutely deserves more seasons.",5
Lucifer ,"Please I've read the moans petitions about how this glorifies Satan.. Sorry but so does Supernatural. Why do people in the US take this stuff so seriously. It a send up OK? Lucifer is witty and charming with fabulous one liners. The plot is terrible. (So are many of Supernaturals... Sorry guys) but we don't watch it for that.. if we believed every series on TV. I'd be walking around with a tin foil hat ""Cos Aliens are here"" Back to the Pilot.... Our British lead Tom Ellis was all suave and smooth like a very old Brandy. Whilst Lauren German was a little Ditsy but his nemesis, but in truth sexy and funny. A future partner in crime.With myself and a few hundred UK Facebook friends we can't wait for the next episode. Please.. those petitioners who wanted this banned. have you seen it? Did it make you at least chuckle? Still Nope here's a secret, Aliens have landed!",5
Lucifer ,"This show is one of the best shows I've ever seen (and I have seen a LOT of shows). It has an incredible cast, it has a perfect balance of being hilarious and serious. With the exception of the s1 and s3 villain, you just can't help but fall in love with every character. After that season 3 finale, WE NEED MORE LUCIFER!! Despite not having proper promotion (or merchandise!) by the network, this show has managed to build a global fanbase PURELY because of how excellent it is. I have never been this passionate about a show before, and whomever picks it up is set to gain MILLIONS of customers all (impatiently) waiting to flock to any new place our wonderful Devil goes. :)",5
Lucifer ,"SPOILER: So FOX cancelled Lucifer without a reason. Now the whole world is trying to save it with #savelucifer #renewlucifer #pickuplucifer. But after seeing this season finale... i'm SHOCKED! This badass ending was a hell of a cliff hanger! And what does FOX do, agian they cancel a good show. WHAT THE HELL FOX??And nobody is saying it, but i think it's about the ""glorifying the devil"" issues, but whores and drugs on tv are no problem....? Thinking those faithfull people need to stick with fithing the real issues out there, on the streets.",5
Lucifer ,"I heard the news that FOX is cancelling Lucifer... I just dont get it, A show with rating 8,2 on IMDB with over 100k votes, what is lately rare, and then PUFF! Lets cancel it... I do not know what was the way of thinking of the person behind this and i just cant figured it out.
But i guess another reality show is coming or another crap like that...
Maybe Netflix or HBO will pick it up as they do know how to make a good TV Series work,",5
Lucifer ,"I don't understand why this show got canceled! I've watched so many crime/drama/fantasy series, and none quite like this! The devil himself on a path to salvation, and the magical romance between Decker and Lucifer is even better than watching Booth and Brennan! This show has so many layers and so much potential! Someone pick up this show! Things can't end like this now that Decker finally knows his secret!!!",5
Lucifer ,One of the best shows I have ever seen. Alot of times it helped me to get through the rough days and also helped me understand alot of emotions because I could've relate to the shown emotions on it and feel like someone is always there for me when I need it the most. So I really 't believe it's getting canceled. I hope this decission will change.,5
Lucifer ,"Losing the red horn and pitchfork for debonair skin, the titular entity roams our world with wealth and taste. Lucifer is a quirky, somewhat mischievous take on the fallen angel. It has many pop references, cool soundtracks and more importantly, a smooth convincing acting from the lead actor Tom Ellis.Far from menacing, Lucifer is a magnetic gentleman. He wears nice suits, talks in charming accent and is very manipulative. The way he is displayed here hinges a lot on persuasion. He oozes confident, able to affect others with ease but without being overly callous or arrogant. Tom Ellis just struts as though he embraces the characters, the confidence is nearly infectious.Production has all sort of nifty flair. Visual utilizes light tone, it gives more cinematic feel than most series, probably to portray the larger than life persona. Soundtracks are very good, the music is a mix of pop, rock and rap, which will resonate with audience in youthful fashion.Characters are pretty inviting, and it's not just about Lucifer himself. Supporting roles play good parts too, the female police looks sympathetic enough for long term strange partnership, almost in odd buddy cop gimmick. It leaves many possibilities for future episodes, maybe it ventures into case of the week or just expanding on how manipulative Lucifer can be without becoming too sinister for silver screen.Not sure how long Lucifer will walk the TV or how he will maintain the nature of the series in the long run, but as far as introduction goes, it is done with great taste. Fascinatingly classy and with a touch of devilry, please give Lucifer the courtesy of your viewing.",4

Kesari,A very sharp script with a powerfull performance.The screenplay is superb.akshay kumar's acting is top notch.watch it for sure.,5
Kesari,"From the beginning of the movie till ending visually it's awesome that too in such budget, story is all about history which has to know every Indian how 21 sikhs fought woth 10000 patans and sacrifices their lifes movie is emotionally connected particularly last 20 mints of climax, bgm work is good, director has succeeded with his script, dialogues he delivered good out put in limited budget all though we can find few minor flaws but that will be not a problem for general audience, editing should have been bit tighter,Over all technical values are good enough.Akshay Kumar's best performance till date, he lived in the character throughout the movie so natural kudos to him for choosing such kind of subjects he is becoming versatile actor, parineeti chopra has very minor role but promising one she has done her best in limited time, all other 21 sikhs and every other character had done very good job.Final verdict-go and watch this emotional action drama saga am sure you won't regret.",5

Kesari,"Guys, ignore all haters and go to this movie. This movie is masterpiece from Akshay sir.. Actually, I was expecting a good movie from akki sir but this movie is lifetime best for me now ..",5
Kesari,"Akshay's best movie. The CGI is impeccable. If you are not aware of Sikh martial art than you would not understand the fight sequences. If you visit a Sikh Akhada where they practice martial art you would exactly see what Akshay has done. He has brought out the true Sikh Martial Art essence. The slow motion is not over the top because it is exactly how they fight.
The film flows beautifully. The graphics and the sound design is absolutely spot on. Direction has been at its finest.
Every Indian must watch this film.",5
Kesari,Kesari is a very good movie and Akshay sir has a very nice acting,5

Kesari,"Awesome movie,everyone should watch, nd knw the bravery of sikh batellion",5
Kesari,The main character hallucinates of loved ones as he rarely gets to see them. The movie emotionally connects to the audience. It is based on true events. The music contains hymns related to Sikhism. Action is superb. Villains have acted well.,5
Kesari,"Kesari was one of the most awaiting movie of these year which is based on the Battle of Saragarhi was fought on 12 September 1897 between Sikh soldiers of the British Indian Army and Pashtun Orakzai tribesmen (legions of Afghans). It occurred in the North-West Frontier Province, (modern-day Khyber Paktunkhwa, Pakistan). The Sikhs, led by Halvindar Ishar Singh, chose to fight to the death, which is considered as one of history's bravest battle ever fought.No doubt Akshay Kumar has given many of the best performances in his Career, but these one is Outstanding, one of the best. Akki in portray of Halvindar Ishar Singh nailed it. Parineeti Chopra is good in Special performances. Rakesh Chaturvedi Om is superb in negative performance, you will really hate him in role of Saidullah.Director Anurag Singh has done very good job. Action Pack Scenes are heart of the movie. Action Director Parvez Shaikh & Lawrence Woodward have done execellent work. Cinematography is fantastic by Anshul Chobey. Climax is really awesome, will left you in emotions and make you proud to be an Indian too.Overall, Kesari is an Action packed & Heart touching movie. Its a treat for Holi & these weekend. Don't miss these one at any cost. Go for it.",4
Kesari,"Selection of location was also great,
great sounds.. i don't like songs in movies so that that as a salt.overall great movie. everyone should watch it",5
Kesari,Best movie even better then 300. Without technology they fight with courage salute to all 21 Sikh Worriers.,5
Kesari,The whole movie was like a climax scene. Each and every scene was outstanding and whistle worthy. You just can't afford to miss it.,5
Dumbo,"This is one of the worst ever Disney's cinema movies. Completely souless this is a forced progressive, naive, PC remake.
It does almost everything wrong, looks like Disney had a really innocent childish pc script and needed something to make it look a little darker, so why not just offer a ton of money to Burton? He does add a little darkness, but is so little that former Dumbo looks like a psychological thriller compared with this one.
I think it is fair to say this is the worst Burton's movie ever, the only good things are Eva Green and Dany De Vito's acting.
Do not waste your time nor your good child memories.",1
Dumbo,"Movie starts off good, looks good and Danny Devito is excellent. But again poor casting,poor acting, poor story and extreme amounts of superficial political correctness ruin what could of been a great movie.",1
Dumbo,"Disney, what is wrong with you??? Who in the Sam Hill is picking your directors, actors, screenwriters, etc? Give them their walking papers so they can go back to their old jobs at Walmart.
Take my advice and stay as far away from this disaster flick as possible. Rent or buy the 1941 original Dumbo.",1
Dumbo,"We went to watch it, the whole family. Me, my wife, my daughter, and my mother in law. I was kinda ready for a not so good movie, but boy did I overestimated this joke!
I almost fell asleep 3 times, my mother in law did, and my wife as well. My daughter played with the rest of the kids in the theater, playing hide and seek and tag.
There was no single person in the full room who enjoyed it. Many people were napping, some were on their phones. The rest were bored to death.
Nothing about this movie was enjoyable. The color palette was typical for Burton, washed down and bleak. The actors played like they had firing line pointed at them. Most of the characters were flat like an ironing board. No character development at all. Dany DeVito was really trying to have this circus going on, but the clowns were suicidal.
The CGI was kinda goodish only during Pink Elephants on parade, the rest was made with pocket money budget.
Unfortunately no feather is able to lift this slob from the ground!1 star is really generous in this case. IMDB should allow negative rating for ""movies"" like this....",1
Dumbo,"No stalk, no drunk dumbo. Just a rubbish film. Terrible remake.",1
Dumbo,"Don't go see this lest you want to be called a dumbo. Totally re-written from the original just to pander to liberal sensibilities which include portraying the little carny girl as a brilliant up and coming dreamer who someday will grow up to be a scientist. Yes, a scientist! Oh brother. And yet her little brother tags along everywhere she goes mindlessly living moment-to-moment with no aspirations whatsoever. Ah how cute, typical toxic male characteristics. Then there is the super-evil corporate giant who wants to own it all, yet at the cost of destroying everything. Enough already with the nonsense. Yes we get it, we all should hate business enterprise and greed because ultimately they will destroy the earth and put us all in chains - at least what's left of us.Except for one Danny DeVito the cast just stumbles through the whole mess. They all look like the overly starched shirts of the times. They deliver their lines as if they're suffering from bad hangovers.Disney really needs to get back on track. They cannot even take a simple sweet story which really tugs at your heartstrings without turning it into a bloated liberal manifesto. Hey, the name Dumbo is already taken, so don't go see this movie.",1
Dumbo,"Nobody can act in this film expect Danny Devito,he is only actor in this movie. What's worse is that a fake elephant is the most real thing in this film.Just don't waste time and money to see DUMBo",1
Dumbo,"I grew up obsessed with Dumbo. I was so excited to take my nieces to see this and it was so boring and a huge disappointment. My oldest niece got scared and crawled on top of me a refused to watch it. My husband felt the movie took some political stances. It was overall a very full movie, the acting was subpar, and my poor nieces didn't even enjoy themselves.",1
Dumbo,"Honestly, he was the only good thing about the film. Every single actor forgot they were actors, everything felt so fake and forced, there was no magic. I don't understand why Disney keeps making these remakes. Yes, they have amazing CGI, but they seem to forget the story they're trying to tell. I think this is the worst live-action remake they've done so far.",1
Dumbo,"They really managed to overcomplicate a sweet and simple storyline, causing the original message to get lost in an entirely different story, the same story which Hollywood has been shoving down our throats repeatedly the last ten or so years. It's getting old. This 'new' message of 'large corporations bad/underdogs good', followed the clich that all successful businessmen are greedy, heartless, power-hungry monsters who'll do anything to get what they want. An overplayed roll at the best of times. Surprisingly the main character was no longer Dumbo, but a little girl, who fit the cookie cutter Hollywood standard: Little girl who overcomes the patriarchy, (represented in this instance by her father), to live her dream of being a scientist. Again, the same story we've had shoved down our throats in countless other movies has now taken over one of Disney's most classic stories of self-discovery. It was entirely disappointing. You see, at the theaters we have a unique opportunity to escape politics and everyday life to live in a world of fantasy for whatever brief period we've been allotted to go there. Disney believed that if you're only catering to children then you've already failed at entertaining. I'd like to add upon that by saying that if you only aim to tell the same story repeatedly, injecting it in to previous stories that were perfect good without it, then you've failed at story telling. Somewhere along the line Hollywood only managed to remember a single story in the vast empire of stories it's accumulated throughout the years, and that story is what was represented here. Not Dumbo, the story which Disney brought to life and inspired millions with over generations. But the same story you've seen in a hundred movies over the past few years. Why bother going to watch it at all? You already know the story, and it isn't Dumbo...
Okay that was harsh. Positive sides of this monstrosity now...The acting was good, despite the butchered storyline. The actors did an amazing job...AND special effects were pretty cool as well, so good on the special effect's artists, that could not have been easy...As that's 2 positive traits I was able to find, I think it's fair I give the movie at least 2 stars.",1
Dumbo,"This was an embarrassing remake of Dumbo.
First, the hue or color tone of the movie was so unnatural, almost campy, like I had stumbled into a showing of Batman and Robin. It distracted me constantly reminding me that I was at the movies watching actors instead of being part of a story. Secondly, the young female actress did not help that situation at all. She presence was very distracting. Her acting was wooden and unbelievable. She was a carny's kid, living in a circus in 1919 but in every scene, she looked like she had just gotten out of the shower. It was hard to watch.
Finally, who is green lighting these Disney's screenplays? Fire all of them! This movie was called Dumbo but it was about so many other things the elephant and the real story that was told in the original was lost or buried. I was looking forward to these remakes but if they continue to rewrite them I will pass on the rest.",1
Dumbo,"Wow, talk about marketing deception, When i first saw the trailers for Dumbo I was wowed, the magic was there on the screen. However when I actually paid for a ticket to see this movie, I felt as though I had walked into another theater and was duped. This movie was a travesty from the get go. The kid actors were the absolute worst, they were SO ANNOYING. All the actors were miscast, you felt disconnected and there was no magic at all. By far one of the worst Disney remakes in history and one of the worst films of the year. AVOID AT ALL COST!",1
Dumbo,"This film should be catalogued as animal cruelty for what Tim Burton did to poor Dumbo.This must be the worst Disney film I've ever seen and it's an insult to the surreal vision of love and triumph over overwhelming odds that was the original.
How can it be that the animated version is far more mature and intelligent than the live action one?How can my intelligence feel so insulted by a movie with absolutely no heart and no brain to a point that when I feel compelled to tell people to avoid this like the plague? The movie doesn't make up its mind about what it wants to say or what it wants to be. Is it a critic to Disney buying small (and huge) properties? Does it want to send a ""family"" message? Does it want to say that doesn't matter how you are born (big ears), what you like (science) or what happened to you (losing an arm) it's ok because it's you who matters? No, it doesn't dwell on any of it because god forgive we give the children something to actually think about and have 2 or 3 upset moms feel offended that a movie told their children to be strong in the face of adversity.No, the biggest intelligible lesson from this film is ""when in doubt snort something"" which is a really questionable choice for a film that tries to be as politically correct as possible. I prefer the crows teaching me and Dumbo to believe in yourself even when you lost your mom and and the world seems to be against you.There was a reason why the original was a hit and has become a classic even despite its period derived racism which as a non white I have to say never saw the racism in.Oh yeah, that's another thing, you really wanted to correct the so called ""racism"" from the original? Why not make the family that gets Dumbo through the rough stuff positive black role models?Only positive thing about it? Dumbo looks really cute.This movie is junk food and I don't want my money back. I want my two hours of life back.How dare you sirs? How dare you....",1
Dumbo,"I accept the notion of an elephant flying more than the pretend political correctness of characters set in this time period. It's a condensed version of the original for 45 minutes, then what should have been a sequel. If they had given the original plot the time it needed, they would have made an amazing movie.Why can't we just have a movie about a flying elephant? Why do we need a million unrelated agendas? There's no way to be invested in that many themes, so there's no connection with the characters. He can fly. He wants his mom. That's all you need.",1
Dumbo,"DumboBurton's live action Disney take on an emotionally driven circus act is profoundly dull. Probably, this has always been the risk that Tim Burton's (the director) sketchy cartoonish world comes with. Even looking at his previous projects, you can easily say that each of the visual galores could have gone wrong. But it is that fine analysation of emotion that Burton personifies on a screen with one dimensional characters; that makes it, against all odds, much better. So when you hear about the collaboration of Burton and Disney, you would think that it is a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, you are going to lose that bet, for carrying out such a wallop of drama, he has decided to surf above it, in fact hover around it, but will not and does not get his hand dirty.There is no string attached to the storytelling, no thread to link them all, ironically in a concept where everyone is rooting for one innocent character. You feel physically distant with this world, not when it tries to brag about its cookiness but when expresses the humane qualities. Although, for a brief period, it does get your feet taping in rhythm, but the credit goes to the ""teamwork"" theme that Disney has been endorsing since ages.The performance is decent coming from Danny DeVito as a goofy manager and Nico Parker as a sweet host of the storyline. And on the other hand, major contenders like Colin Farrell as an over brooding post war hero, Eva Green as the dame and Michael Keaton as a stereotypical evil billionaire fails to make our heart pump fast. Dumbo is not the example to put on a table full of love letters to Disney films, what humanized the animated version in the early 40s, is alienated vigorously by shattering our childhood memories.",0
Dumbo,"Disney owes me money for therapy bills. I left halfway through, and I feel like I forced myself to stay too long.",1
Dumbo,"It was a very expensive attempt but the trailer Is better that the actual film. I can not fathom why Burton directed the actors, mainly ,Michael Keaton and Alan Arkin in their worst performances of their lives. The girls delivery of her lines was flat.The film looks gorgeous but the total experience was forgettable. A real shame.",1
Dumbo,"Another crass remake made by Tim Burton, Dumbo fails to deliver hardly anything good to write home about (aside from Danny Devito's performance). It follows the trope-heavy screenplay of ""the kids are always right, adults are wrong"" that just makes you want to sigh constantly. The ""bad"" guys are obvious from the very moment they are introduced and don't actually get revealed as bad until further in the movie, which normally wouldn't be bad in a Disney movie since they are meant to be carried by the musicals and animation, however this doesn't work for Dumbo at all since there are no musical numbers and the villains are revealed in a painstakingly obvious way.
Since this is an adaptation of the 1941 film by Walt, it's fair to draw comparisons despite being very different films. First off is time. Dumbo 1941 was able to tell a very simple story about an elephant that finds out it can fly in an hour and four minutes, and much of this time was taken up by the musical numbers. Those musical numbers are what made the film a classic, not the story. The actual story of Dumbo is simple, it doesn't meander on the fact that the elephant can fly and keep writing story after the elephant flies because it risks losing the wonder and amazement of the spectacle. Dumbo 2019 however takes the approach of introducing the flying elephant very early in the film and follows a poorly written trope-heavy screenplay about the utilization and conflict over the flying elephant. The biggest offenders for myself were Burton's rendition of Pink Elephants, which is only a minor callback in this film and lacks nearly all the iconic elements which made ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" a cinematic spectacle with the original Dumbo. ""Baby Mine"" had a fairly good rendition, not great, but it was one of the better parts. Also included was a reference to the Crows' song, however it was only a joking reference which is like pouring salt on the wounds of a person like myself who wanted to see well done renditions of the classic film. The film is also very dark, with generally hazy skies and dark lighting, the average Tim Burton style. It fits the screenplay but as a whole I despised that stylistic choice with a Disney movie about a flying elephant.
Aside from watching Danny Devito sing Casey Jr. this movie is a skip. I nearly walked out of the theater after Pink Elephants crushed my spirits but hoped for a good musical rendition after the credits rolled (adding onto my disappointment as there was none). Just go watch the original Dumbo, save an extra 50 minutes wasted on a meandering screenplay, and forget that Tim Burton ruined another remake.",1
Dumbo,"This is a lovely film that deserves to be discovered by each generation. Best acting performance of every characters in this film. Everybody should jump aboard experience the circus with DUMBO. No matter how old you are, you just might get something out of it. Not all of it's pretty, but it's always cute and ultimately very funny. I love you DUMBO !!",5
Dumbo,"I'll try to keep this simple.
Disney should be ashamed.
Tim Burton should be ashamed.
The screenwriters should be ashamed.
The actors should be ashamed.
Most of all the visual effects supervisor should be ashamed.The visual effects were third rate. I cannot begin to express how awful and unrealistic they are. And this is the 21st century. The story was pointless-muddled as to who the narrative is about. In a cliche summary: this is two hours of my life I will not get back. I hope I will have saved you that.",1
Dumbo,"My girlfriend and I went to see this movie and came out disappointed.
I've watched the original Dumbo cartoon a lot when I was a child, and remember it to be dark and very sad but with a happy ending.Watching this movie I did not feel that emotion at all. Kind of like to how the children in this movie act. There was no emotional connection between the children and little baby elephant with huge ears. The only look the little girl could do was smile, look pretty and have a fake tear on her cheek.As a circus with (fake) freaks they would have been blessed to have a real baby elephant with those big ears, and the audience would have loved everything about it. I understand the original cartoon they also laugh at Dumbo, but that's because he is very clumsy with those big ears.They way the script has been written to make Dumbo unwanted just does not work. I really miss the mouse Timothy. The children are not a good replacement because of the bad acting.The first 45 minutes of the movie consists of the original story of the cartoon and I expected to see the end credits roll, and that would have been fine.
But then the movie drags on with the story making it over the top and laughable.Like when the woman starts to ride Dumbo looks really silly. My girlfriend and I looked at each other and just started laughing. Michael Keaton is trying to perform a role as bad guy, but he turns out being just stupid when he starts smashing the power station of his circus destroying everything he owns.Also to see Dumbo gets risen up to perform his flying trick for like 4 times in a row got really boring at the end. We've seen him fly multiple times allready!
And why does Dumbo have to snort up this feather like it's his drug or something. In the cartoon he just holds the feather, not snort it.A lot of bad decisions made this movie a big mess. Dumbo looks cute though.",1
Dumbo,"We were expecting so much more. The kid actors were HORRIBLE, especially the girl. When Danny Devito is the best actor in the film, you know it's bad. I really, really wanted to love this.",1
Dumbo,"Wow this film is dull. Perhaps it just wasn't our thing but it felt waaay too long, the story was very very simple and they somehow managed to make it last nearly 2 hours. The last 30 mins was great, but it was painful getting there. I should have just waited until it came out on netflix.",1
Dumbo,"2019/20 No.1 Razzie award. A total lack of emotions comes through. Aspect ratio deceiving, if you expect sudden brilliance.",1
Dumbo,I was so looking forward to this movie. I wanted to love it so much but just couldn't. Really bad job done with this one.,1
Romeo Akbar Walter,"I think people downrating it comparing it to Raazi are misguided. The overall story is much more complex than Raazi. I do think that it could have done with more deft execution but I didn't find it as slow as websites are saying. Reviews by media houses are pathologically biased because the movie is based on a nationalistic theme. Its definitely not a bore and is pretty intense especially in the second half. It's not overtly jingoistic and maintains a good realistic tone. Infact, the conclusion is much better than Raazi. I felt that the story with Mouni Roy could have been done away with. The true surprise is Jackie Shroff. He's a complete show stealer. Overall its a solid 8 from me.",4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"I'm astonished at two things. 1) This well made, riveting espionage thriller. 2) How low can the paid media and biased reviewers can stoop down to negatively project the movie for no reason. There is nothing political or jingoistic about this movie but the right amount of patriotism, good story-telling, cinematography, direction and awesome twist! this movie is based on true events/inspired by the story of the RAW agent Ravindra Kaushik (aka Black Tiger) but not exactly his story. However, this is tribute to all those unsung heroes who sacrifice everything in order to protect the Motherland from inside the enemy territories.
John Abraham did well, Jackie Shroff was pretty good, Sikander Kher was good and the others performed decent too. The movie could use better editing and handling of some loopholes but it's still a realistic and pretty good watch. Somehow I liked it even more than Raazi. So don't listen to the negative reviews and watch it yourself.
Some people are giving it low ratings purposely because perhaps they still can't digest the truth about 1971 Bangladesh liberation war/Indo-Pak war.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Loved the movie. It is a must watch. The detailing for a film set in the 1970's is amazing. Everything, right from the dressing style to the hairstyles, to the gadgets, to the vehicles... It reflects the era in which the film is set.
John Abraham, Jackie Shroff, Sikander Kher, Anil George... All have done a wonderful job. The art direction is awesome and so is the direction.
Just felt that Mouni Roy's character was not developed well enough. The romantic angle did not need to be there.
Other than that, the film is fantastic.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,Good movie could have been a little faster and therefore used the spare time for further character and plot development.,5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Watching this movie, One can understand the difficulty of being a spy and missing family. There are many such agents whose identity is kept secret and there sacrifice has helped the nation.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Much better than razi

Romeo Akbar Walter,"Not sure about the other reviews but I think it was definitely a good script, good acting. Worth 8 stars.",4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Guys, a great watch I must say. I like the story and the direction, it will keep you on the edge with every scene.
End is a twist",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Romeo Akbar Walter is an impressive action thriller that however might not impress die-hard thriller fans, largely because the twists (except a few) and suspenseful moments are pretty much predictable. This doesn't really harm the film since it's gripping and frequently gives up tension and action throughout the duration.I'd say that the trailers pretty much spoiled the film. After watching the film, I really feel they shouldn't have given some integral parts in the promos because that kills the surprise factor, although the director provides another twist to cover for it. Robbie Grewal has done a decent job but he has added songs too randomly. A film like this doesn't need singing and love tracks even if short.The first half is gripping and the plotting is excellent. The interval twist is outstanding. That's the one thing I can call truly unpredictable. The second half also goes on to take the conflict further and several scenes are outstanding. I must also mention that the emotional moments are captivating from start to finish and the action sequences are also very impressively staged, most notably the chase that is all over the promos. There is, however, some extreme violence, so be warned. I could already see and hear the audience getting terrified during one such scene.John Abraham delivers a terrific act. Jackie Shroff also occasionally performs well. Mouni Roy just happens to be there. The villains are menacing and the complex relations between characters are one of the many things this film gets right. The weather depicted throughout the duration makes its presence felt. The climax is also impressive, even though it feels a little stretched.Romeo Akbar Walter is not the most unique spy film largely because those familiar with movies about espionage won't find it surprising. Still, I liked the film a lot and didn't feel bored or exhausted for even a second. I wanted a dramatic action thriller, and that's what I got. That being said, RAW will not disappoint action fans either. It's really enjoyable and worth watching also due to its interesting espionage theme that appeals to viewers of all ages.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,Nature of the film is diffrent than others its a good film good direction and cinematography John Abraham's performance is damn good.except the laging of first half the film gives a superb second half and a mindich blowing climax.in the secind half lots of twists and turns there overall good film worth to watch,4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"First of all this movie is based on a true story. Yes, there was a raw agent in real as depicted in the movie. It's not like any other raw movies of Bollywood like -ek tha tiger. You should definitely watch this movie. And yes there are many twists and turns but in the later half of the movie. The first part is quite pridictable.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,John is amazing! Must watch film. Hats of to the writers. Suspence and thrill at its best.,5
Romeo Akbar Walter,It's a fantastic movie with great screenplay it's not typical bollywood it's par with Hollywood real drama it's slow but it's super script which need to be understand with every scene which are above average human understanding limits which is why its intelligence people movie,5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Brief Synopsis:
Set in the backdrop of the 1971 Bangladesh war, RAW tells the story of Romeo (John Abraham), a bank cashier who is hired by RAW to infiltrate into Pakistan and pass on covert information to them. What happens when the cover of the blue eyed boy of RAW is blown? Is he disowned by his own people? Is he just treated as a pawn in the bigger scheme of things? Does he become a liability to his own government, someone who is easily dispensable? This forms the rest of the plot.Review:
John Abraham as the master of disguise (Romeo, Akbar and Walter) gets into the character with ease, displaying various emotions like fear when he is first recruited by RAW; angst, when he is disowned by his own when his cover is blown & presence of mind when he is confronted with difficult situations while trying to spy on Paki officials with ease. Really the Ace in the pack of cards.Sikandar Kher, as Col Khan from the ISI does a great job as a sadist who enjoys pulling out peoples nails as a part of the third degree torture while humming a sweet song.
Jackie as the RAW chief Srikant Rai gives a restrained performance and is one of the strongest links which binds the film together.Rest of the cast like Raghuvir Yadav, Suchitra Krishnamurthy, Mouni Roy have also done a decent job with their small but well etched out characters.Why is the film not as gripping as Raazi?Though a decent one time watch & despite dwelling in the same genre as Raazi which was an awesome film to say the least, RAW falters a bit with its lack of past paced action owing to the slow narrative inspite of a stellar cast. This is unfortunately what brings the film down by a notch when compared to Raazi which had all of the above.There is a twist in the tale at the climax but it is so far-fetched that probably even the popping out of Jim Carrey's eyes in the film MASK would seem normal to most.But to cut the makers some slack, RAW has its moments, though not enough to keep the audiences glued to their seats (I was yawning a bit in the first half due to the slow narrative). The length of the film should have been reduced by 15-20 mins.Verdict:
A one time watch, not bad yet not too gripping for a film in this genre. I would ideally give it 6.5 stars out of 10 ......but am tempted to add half a star more for the effort put in by the makers. Watch it in the theatres without raising the bar too high and you won't be disappointed.",4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"This film is for those who knows little/more about history specially with Indian wars. For them it's great thriller experience. For others they may not like much, as they expected one of the masala movie.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Loved the movie. It is a must watch. The detailing for a film set in the 1970's is amazing. Everything, right from the dressing style to the hairstyles, to the gadgets, to the vehicles... It reflects the era in which the film is set.

Romeo Akbar Walter,Please dont listen to biased reviews about this movie. It's a must watch. Totally gripped and amazing performance. Suspense on it's peak. It's real surprising element.,4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Forgiving plotholes, the film has good storyline and decent twists. Sikander Kher looks most realistic with his Pakistani accent. I wish other actors did that too.However, narration is too slow for most part and the tension doesn't quite build up like in the similar spy movie Raazi.",4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"I warn you all , DO NOT GO BY THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. If you love your country, you should see the sacrifice made by some of your fellow countrymen. This is a tribute to them. John Abraham totally nailed it. The acting was top notch. This movie does not deserve the hate it's getting. It's a little slow in the first half but guys , do you really want that stupid Bollywood marsala in a patriotic film ? The story building is absolutely fantastic and I loved every bit of it. Last 30 minutes of the movie are breathtaking and you would be at the edge of your seats. I was emotional while walking out of the theatre. Please go to see this movie and keep an open mind. Do not let anybody else's review affect you.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"I would definitely recommend this movie..A mustwatch!The honesty in the story and sincerity in the acting touches you. The at direction is perfect.. Transports you back to the 70's.John is fabulous in his emotions, Jackie very suave, Sikandar nailed the accent, and of course the acting by Raghuveer Yadav and Anil George are commendable. Even the smallest of roles , the beggar for instance, are superbly taken care of and well directed.The first half is slow paced, but is perfect to establish the characters and second half keeps you on the edge of your seats.Mouni's character doesn't work in the film.The director,Robbie, has done a great work... The film evokes patriotic feeling and touches you. It gives you an insight on how the RAW agents work...salutes to them.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"ROMEO AKBAR WALTER is the story of a patriot who takes extreme risks while spying in enemy country. The year is 1971. Romeo Ali (John Abraham) works in India in a bank. He stays with his mother Waheeda (Alka Amin) who is overprotective about him since Romeo's father had died while serving the country. Romeo too has the passion to work for India but is unable to do so due to his mother. However one day he meets Shrikant Rao (Jackie Shroff), head of RAW, and he asks Romeo to join them and spy on Pakistanis on their soil. Romeo agrees and before leaving for training and eventual trip to Pakistan, he lies to his mother that he has been promoted in the bank and that that's why he has been sent for training. In Pakistan, he manages to smartly win the trust of arms dealer Isaq Afridi (Anil George), who's very close to General Zorawar (Purnendu Bhattacharya). While spying on their conversations and activities, Romeo stumbles upon an important information. The Pakistani forces are planning an air strike in Badlipur area of the then East Pakistan. This part of Pakistan is getting rebellious and wants independence. The rebels meanwhile are being trained by Indian forces and a lot of them are stationed at Badlipur, where the Pakistanis plan to drop bombs. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Robbie Grewal's story is promising and could have made for an exciting thriller. Robbie Grewal and Rahul Sen Gupta's screenplay however is very weak and flawed. The scenes don't flow well and the narrative is quite incoherent. Audiences might not be able to easily comprehend what's going on. There are too many loopholes that even a layman will be able to point out. Robbie Grewal, Ishraq Eba and Shreyansh Pandey's dialogues are well worded but nothing memorable.Robbie Grewal's direction is not upto the mark. It is evident that he has put in a lot of research but it's of no use when you are not able to use it well. Moreover, audiences won't be able to help but compare the proceedings with RAAZI and it was a far superior product. So this factor also comes in play. Except for the final scene, one doesn't root for Romeo. His bond with his mother seems half baked. Even the romantic track with Parul (Mouni Roy) seems forced. The makers don't even bother to show what happens to Parul later on.John Abraham gives his hundred per cent. The film might disappoint but he won't. His deadpan expressions work very well for his character. Mouni Roy has an interesting part to essay. Though she does well, her character gets a raw deal. Jackie Shroff is dependable but at places, it's difficult to understand what he's speaking. Sikandar Kher oozes fear and terror and gets the accent right. Suchitra Krishnamoorthi (Rehana Kazmi) is fine but has very little to do. Anil George is damn impressive. Raghubir Yadav (Mudassar) leaves a mark. Purnendu Bhattacharya is okay. Rajesh Shringapure (Awasthi) and Nawab Afridi (Shadaab Amjad Khan) do well.The music has no scope and seems forced. 'Bulleya' fails to strike a chord. 'Maa' is forcefully added. 'Vande Mataram' is played in the end credits. 'Allah Hoo Allah' is needless while 'Jee Len De' is there for just a minute. Hanif Shaikh's background score is quite loud but works in enhancing impact.Tapan Tushar Basu's cinematography is appropriate. Madhur Madhavan and Swapnil Bhalerao's production design gives the film a nice retro touch. Same goes for Ameira Punvani's costumes. The clothes worn by Mouni is in sync with the era shown. Prana and Pixel D's VFX is passable. Nilesh Girdhar's editing is quite slow and the film is too long at 144 minutes.",2
Romeo Akbar Walter,"I would suggest all of you after watching this movie, please read the actual HISTORY of 1971 war between Pakistan and Bangladesh. Then you will be able to understand what actually happened.
Thank you.",1
Romeo Akbar Walter,If this movie doesn't get rating the india don't deserve good movies.,5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"This movie was very slow paced and the songs and romantic scenes were totally unnecessary,which as a result caused the movie to suffer in terms of quality.
John Abraham although very likeable is a very ordinary actor and continues to be so.
Jackie Shroff somehow takes a thrill in having a very stupid looking appearance on screen and continues to do so.
Everyone's acting (except Sikander Kher who was quite good) was very ordinary.
Not good enough to watch in the cinema.",2
Pet Sematary,"I'm not crazy about going to the movies and if something doesn't call to me, I'll usually wait for Netflix or blu ray. I made that mistake when the IT Chapter 1 remake came out and I really regretted it. I'm a huge fan of the original Pet Sematary and I remember Zelda giving me insane nightmares when I was young. I would hear ""Racheellll"" at night and freak myself out!This movie did not disappoint. It was fun and I took my 10 year old son with me to watch it and he loved it as well. I was worried about the R rating and honestly I think it could have passed for PG13. My son and I shared quite a few scares and jumps throughout the movie, along with the rest of the theater.I only gave 8 stars because there were a few things that I could have done without. One major plot change from the original story was unnecessary I felt. It changes the tone for the entire movie and I'm not sure it was a good thing. There were a few cliches and plot holes that bugged me but all in all I had a great time with this movie and I think a ton of other people will too!",4
Pet Sematary,"Ok, first when I saw the trailer of this movie I honestly thought it wasn't gonna beat the original. But turns out I was VERY wrong! Now I might understand why some people think it's worse than the original, But I think it beats the absolute crap out of the original. (Btw I really love John lithgow and Jason clarke) it's probably one of the best remakes I've ever watched. 8/10",4
Pet Sematary,"If you're looking for an antidote to Disney and Marvel, then toughen up for this one. We get only a vague idea of what exactly caused this family to move to ""the sticks"" in search of a better life. The couple seems to be carrying their own neurotic baggage as the movie begins, and things only worsen when their neighbor, a grizzled John Lithgow, introduces them to Pet ""you-know- what,"" located alarmingly close by. This version of King's novel is so much better than the original, that it's difficult to complain about the new emphasis on the wife's character, which I think is an added touch - and may actually be a good thing, since it suggests the seeds of the horror have been planted years before the script begins - at least for her. Make no mistake about it, though, as hard as it is to watch, it does have a cathartic effect : your own troubles will pale in comparison.",5
Pet Sematary,"""Better."" The original Pet Sematary was my pick for the scariest of King movies, having seen it as an adolescent. This version contains more believable characters, relationships, foreshadowing, and esthetics. One line really didn't sell it for me, but you'll notice that all on your own. Overall, the acting improved in this version. The twists hit me much harder than rewatching the original. I personally enjoyed this one much more and loved the ending. That said, you'll find the sweetest reasons to be drawn to something scarier as an adult, so be aware that only a few scenes really gripped my adult self. Heart pounding, can't breathe kind of grip those had on me, it was the kid in me that would've gave it a ten.",4
Pet Sematary,"I was lucky enough to check this out at an advance screening and was very surprised after not really thinking the trailers looked that great. I've always loved the original and have thought it has stood the test of time, but this new film executes the original story concept very well if not even better, with only a couple big changes. The dark and tragic tone is set from the start and never lets up throughout. There are some moments and scares that do follow modern horror cliches, but there are definitely some that are built up by magnificent ominous atmosphere. Jason Clarke once again shows he's an underrated actor that has some genuine humanity and emotion in his performance. John Lithgow is also very solid as well as Amy Seimitz. The camerawork is very crisply shot and creative and creates some fantastic visuals of the haunting wilderness settings. There are some moments towards the end that seemed rushed, but overall this is another great new age horror remake that honestly deserves loads of credit for following subject matter properly.",4
Pet Sematary,"First of all i want to say that i haven't seen the original movie or red the book, so i had a lack of referenses, and no hopes at all before went to the cinema.I was surprisingly happy about this one. First i was a little annoyed, but after a while i in to it and i was experienced a much more psychological horror that was pretty disturbing to me on a deeper level.I think John Lithgow did an amazing job too.",5
Pet Sematary,"From the trailers, I was so excited to see this. I'm a huge fan of the novel, and whilst I'm well aware a certain amount of artistic licence goes into putting a book onto the big screen, they changed so much of the story that it was barely recognisable.
I understand why they changed which child was killed, you'd be hard pushed to find a toddler that can act as the living dead, but it didn't work with the older child either. In the book, the resurrected 'being' was taken over by a demon-in the film, Ellie is well aware she is dead, and she's living an unwanted 'afterlife' of which she is also aware, and it turns her evil.
There is no atmosphere in the film, the setting should be creepy and atmospheric, but I'll be honest, the scenes in the woods look very much like a stage set with dry ice covering the floor. It looks cheap and thrown together. The story is patchy and nonsensical in many places, it feels rushed to get to the end, and none of the characters are padded out enough for you to actually care about.
The one shining light in this is John Lithgow as Jud, he's incredibly well cast, but the let down with him is they didn't utilise him like they should have. One of my favourite parts of the novel is the friendship that develops between Louis and Jud, it's beautiful in places, and we learn a lot about Jud, his life, the burial ground, what becomes of anyone or anything that's buried there etc. But in the film he's just some old guy that pops up every now and then, with no real background-and there isn't a single whisper of the MicMacs and their part in the burial ground.
I also didn't like how in the film, they justified Rachel's irritating and bizarre neuroses about death by having her be responsible for her own sisters death, that was a completely new plot line addition for the purpose of the film
As for the ending, I'm not even sure I have it in me to comment, the ending turned it into a pseudo comical farce-the book left me feeling bleak and slightly bereft.
However, I'd like to give a special mention to the cat, the cat played his part beautifully!",3
Pet Sematary,"This was great. Everyone who hated it seems to; hate it because it's not word for word the book. Well, so what? You liked the book. Now you have a NEW thing to enjoy.
Or saw the original nearly 30 years ago and want to reclaim that awesome child hood feeling and guess what, you're 30 and that's not happening. This is an awesome movie. Watch it and have fun.",5
Pet Sematary,I'm happy to announce that this is better than the first movie. Doesn't happen very often but this is one of those. Really creepy and the acting is really good. One change was a somewhat strange but seemed to work. Excellent horror.,4
Pet Sematary,"Sometimes i wish they would leave the originals alone & when i heard they were remaking pet cemetery..HOW? NOO! Then i remember how brilliant 'IT' was & too my satisfaction, They pulled it off again!..
This surprisingly, is a very stylish & well made horror flick that had me at the edge of my seat. The casting & acting is superb with some stylish backdrops, finally a well made horror for 2019 (im a dog person myself) that being said..A very good film & a well deserved 9/10",5
Pet Sematary,"Pet Sematary: A tale of the Old Gods/Spirits which live in the New England Forests, Gods which predated the Amerindians and forced the local Tribes to flee the area. Infused with Pagan imagery from the beginning as a group of children in animal masks parade to the local animal cemetery - Pet Sematary - to bury a deceased dog. The forest is eerily portrayed by day as Autumnal sunshine penetrates the tree canopy but at night the dark forest exudes primeval terror, even before any of the haunted sites are approached. There is another more mundane horror though, that of trucks and cars which threaten to snuff out life at any moment.A Surgeon, Louis Creed (Jason Clarke) and his family have moved to rural Maine and taken a job in a University Hospital. but he soon faces horror as a student struck by a car is brought in with his brains hanging out. The student dies but Louis has visions of him coming back to life and that night, in a dream is led out into the forest by the student, but when he wakes his feet are covered with mud. His wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz) has her own traumas and guilt over causing the death of her disabled sister, she now has visions of that event. Eight year old daughter Ellie (Jet Laurence) meets local man Jud (John Lithgow) in the Pet Sematary, he warns her about dangers in the forest. When Ellies cat is killed by a truck. Jud brings Louis deep into the woods to inter it in an old burial ground from which animals have come back, the cat returns but is different, wilder. When Ellie is killed in a road accident, Louis is of course tempted to bury her in the same spot. No spoilers here, all of this is revealed in the trailers.A tale of revenants and an evil older than time itself which has preyed on the minds of the Creed family since they first moved to the woods. Lithgow is convincing as the knowledgeable, conflicted local who leads the family onto the road to damnation. Jet Laurence is superb as both the living and dark reanimated Ellie. If the film has flaws then it may be due to having two directors, Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer, as at times it can't seem to decide whether it is a tale of dark comedy or existential terror. But this is a worthy addition to the King Canon with some truly horrific scenes, not for the squeamish. 8.5/10.",5
Pet Sematary,"I've watched the original back when i was a little boy and watch it again several times. It got me scared back then so when the reboot is coming up, i think it will be just like the other horror movie reboot that didn't really change anything from the original. But this movie proves me wrong, it got brave to change a few details from the original. Then, it got way scarier than the original.It got the suspense more than the original and i love how they give more explanation and more stories than the original. I also really loved the ending scene, it's really cool and way much better thank the 1989 film.",5
Pet Sematary,"Did not expect a lot from this movie being a horror fan. But was excellent, lots of jump scares, acting was good and the plot great, I would recommend a watch.",5
Pet Sematary,"Watched it at a pre screening and...now this is what I call a horror movie. The acting was pretty good, there were several emotional aspects at play and I really liked the way they dealt with themes like PTSD and grief.
About the horror part, somes scenes were grotesque and there were a lot of jumpscares and tension building, but I'm not going to spoil anything.Final thoughts: I didn't watch any trailers and from what I could see, most complaints came from people who have watched them. Also, I find it laughable that a weak slasher movie like ""Us"" gets a better rating than this movie, which in my opinion, is way, way better.Veredict: I'd say ""Pet Sematary"" is at least a solid 8, but I gave it a 9 because I strongly disagree with the current 7.0 rating.",5
Pet Sematary,"If you like Stephen King and weird intense movies, this is the one for you. I loved it.",5
Pet Sematary,"I watched it. It was pretty shocking and mixed up like 80's. It's better than 1989 movie. Also, Pet Sematary Two is really boring. Good Work, directors!",5
Pet Sematary,"I really enjoyed it . So as the Maey Lambert version.
I found rhis one a bit more detailed .
Also i just finished the book couple of months before so i need to say not that good as a book. If i dont eead maybe i will satisfied more.",5
Pet Sematary,"I didn't expect much after the trailers gave so much away but It's surprisingly a great film. A lot better than ""Us"", that's for sure.",5
Pet Sematary,"Finally a horror film that isn't too reliant on jump scares and poor cringe worthy dialogue. The character development in this movie is excellent, with great acting and use of flashbacks done so well. This film was rather chilling, not overdoing it with timely sound effects and camera angles to keep the viewer on edge.First horror I've seen in a while that I've enjoyed and it felt quite short because it was so gripping throughout. Worth a watch!",5
Pet Sematary,"No spoilers, obviously the deaths were switched but for the better, this was beyond better than the original and definitely worth watching again and again",5
Pet Sematary,You don't see too many remakes that turn out well but this one sure did!!It was worth going to the theater to see!!!I give it an A+++++ all the way!!The cast of the film were great!!!,5
Pet Sematary,This is what a horror film should be. It has all the stuff that make you cringe and make you not wanna look. Most remakes don't live up to the original but this remake is as good and better than the original with its own twist offs the original! Great Horror Movie!,5
Pet Sematary,"This one was unique and had more detail. It was creepy, scary, and lot's of twist and turns.",5
Pet Sematary,"Just to clarify this right off the bat. This movie is NOT a remake. It is another film adaption based on the 1983 novel by the master of horror, Stephen King. I get sick and tired of people saying 'another useless remake' etc etc. But this film is not. The same as with IT : Chapter One from 2017.Now that is out of the way....Jason Clarke and Amy Seimetz are amazing in there roles of Louis and Rachel Creed. And Jete Laurence who plays there young daughter Ellie also puts on an amazing performance for someone at her young age. John Lithgow also stars and nothing needs to be said about him, as he is great in everything.It's a shame the morons behind the marketing spoiled one of the biggest changes in the movie trailers. Whoever gave them the go ahead to release such a spoiler filled trailer should be fired. The movie is set up perfectly to have that come as a major suprise, and it would have been if the idiots didn't spoil it. If I were the directors I would have been furious.And speaking of changes, the changes do work in the film. If you are a fan of the novel or of the first adaption from 1989, don't go in expecting it to be the similar to either.The film is bleak and dark which of course is what the subject matter is about. Life, love and death are the themes. The film has some jump scares but nothing too jarring or constant. The film is not too graphic, as what others will lead you to believe.I really enjoyed this film. I still prefer the first film adaption a little bit more as I have watched it probably around 100 times since it came out in 1989. But I assure you, I will be watching this adaption many many more times over the years and I can't wait to buy it on both DVD and Blu Ray",5
Pet Sematary,"OMG, the new ""Pet Sematary"" is better than I thought it would be. Better than the original 1989s Pet Sematary. Every time I see the previews I can't tell if I can see cute cat pictures anymore, especially that creepy cat in the film. It's Scary, emotional, and terrifying.Sometimes Dead is Better.",5
Badla,"A great mystery/thriller movie is the one where you guess something and it turns out to be wrong. This is that kind of movie. Acting is average from the supporting cast but the lead cast steals the show.It's good to see Indian movies exploring different Genres. Even though it is a rip off of a foreign movie, you'll enjoy it if you haven't seen the original, like me...",4
Badla,"#BadlaReview
Sujoy Ghosh continuously failed to meet the expectations that he had created with Kahaani!
But the expectations of his comeback were always high. Trailer made Badla look like that comeback movie.
And yes, indeed it is that movie.The whole cast's performances were very realistic and top class.In this revenge Drama, not even a single character is set till the end. Every now and then you keep wondering who is protagonist and who is antagonist.Oh, forgot to mention. There are some references to Mahabharata as well. Also, if you pay attention, below lines become very powerful.
Me 6 dekhu jo tum mjhe dikha rhi ho ya isme chhipa hua 9 dekhu.Answers lies in the details.So we all know that it's a revenge story (Title gives that away). But who is taking revenge? Is this revenge of only one person?What I liked: Direction, acting of the entire cast especially Amitabh, Tapsee and Amrita, production value, screenplay, suspense.What I didn't like: All the characters are shown very intelligent. I can accept that. But sometimes they do silly mistakes, which is not acceptable on seeing their intelligence.Overall: There is not even a single frame that will bore you. Its one of the rare Bollywood movie which keep you engaged from the word GO.
Badla is not one of its kind movie but its one of the best of its kind. Have you watched Kahaani, Drishyam or Andhdhun? Then you must watch #Badla.",5
Badla,"When you watch a remake of an outstanding movie with some mind-blowing twist in the end and some amazing cinematography and acting, you already have your expectations at the next level. To be really fair, I was awestruck after watching ""An invisible guest"" and the effect it left after, but I still watched Badla with a neutral mind and gave it a genuine try. But at the end, I felt I just saw a translated version of it's original. It's a screen by screen copy paste along with 90 percent of the dialogues. The only change was the gender. Come on Ghosh ji, use some of your creativity. Why would you just remake the movie exactly the same. Remake doesn't mean copy paste. For instance, look at Don. That's a fab remake, it not only gave justice to it's predecessor but also took it to a different level. For those of you who liked Badla, just watch it's original and you will understand my super disappointment.",2
Badla,"At the time of watching this movie, no can judge who is killer, this is all time best thriller pack of Bollywood i ever seen, must watch movie...
10/10 ratings,
Acting also superb by all
Specially all favorite Amitabh ji...",5
Badla,"If you think that this is a sequel to the PINK with a social cause and court room drama then you are mistaken . This is a thriller mystery film with suspense and chill . Shot in UK the story starts very slowly with conversation and narratives ...And picks up the speed with revelation and punches ... And picks up the great work of spellbound tight script and leaves you bemused
Everybody is a class in itself",4
Badla,"Simply outstanding.
Without wasting time who are reading my review please do watch this mouth watering suspense mystery..2hours of pure class acting by whole cast..
Please go for it.",5
Badla,Best movie of 2019 everyone should watch story and acting is the backbone of the movie,5
Badla,"First let me give credits to the original movie The Invisible Guest (2016). Awesome remake.
This movie keeps you hooked to the screen till the last second. Brilliant thriller and fantastic performances by every character.",5
Badla,Excellent film brilliant performance from the cast enjoyed it from start to finish best film of 2019,5
Badla,"Its an amazing movie, 1 star less just cuz its a remake. Both characters r well written n shud i talk abt acting skills of AB.. NAA... Let his records speak fr him.",5
Badla,"Although it's a remake of ""The Invisible Guest (Contratiempo) (2017) "" Directed by my personal favorite""Oriol Paulo"",sujoy ghosh with full awesomeness adapted and improvised the story. Amitabh bachchan,tapsee pannu as ovious did thier part awesomly. Tooth gripping, breath taking, forcing you to be on edge of your seats this movie will blow your mind away just like a shotgun fired on a point blank range",5
Badla,Badla is one of the best thriller I have seen in recent times! Edge to seat suspance till the end. Amitji was terrific and tapsee as usual doing great job!,5
Badla,"BADLA REVIEW :-Sujoy Ghosh was the name to look forward since he delivered Classic thriller Kahani. He went quite low with other films but the Expectations of his Comeback were always carried. Badla was looking like that Comeback Film from the Trailer, and the Cast made it look sure shot winner. Now the Final Product is out and it is nothing less that whatever promised. Sujoy Ghosh is Back with another Fine Thriller which should not be missed.Badla is a Revenge Drama where Characters aren't set till the end, you keep getting shocks on alternate occassions asking yourself that who is Protagonist and who is Antagonist? Taapsee Pannu is showcased as Protagonist but is she really that? Amitabh Bachchan plays a Neutral Lawyer throughout the film untill the Brilliant Climax blows you away. Amrita Singh is a Pleasant Surprise as she plays one of the Most Important Role in this Maze. All of them Act with thier souls to make the Chatacters very much audience friendly. Background Music is Top Notch, it gives you that feel of Anger, Scare, Thrill etc. Writing is Perfect, and it was Expected due to Remake thing. Sujoy Ghosh as Director does an Excellent Job, he manages to keep you hooked till the End and forces you to Clap on the Very Last scene. The screenplay in the First half is Ordinary and it could have been much better compared to overall impact of the Film therefore this remains the only let down here.As a Whole, Badla is one of the Finest Thriller made in Bollywood with Magic of Illusional Truth. You keep asking for turnaround moments and Film responds quickly to your requests. The Mahabharata Characters reference works on upper side, generating little bit more Interest. This one is a Sujoy Ghosh Trademark film and should not be missed if you like Quality Films, especially in Thriller Genre. This one would have been a Classic if the First half supported enough. Comparatively, it does not surpass Kahaani but fortunately goes very close to that level, nevertheless Badla is still a Must Watch.RATING - 7/10*",4
Badla,"Hindi movies lack such stories at present time, It was interesting throughout entire length.",5
Badla,"Story is very good.
I always like this type of movie",4
Badla,"This movie is superb.. BLOCKBUSTER
Amitabh Bachchan and Taapsee both are superb acting in these movie.....
I think you should also watch badla movie..",5

Badla,"Badla Movie Is Thriller Suspense Story , New Story Loved It Every minute Of Film Is Full Of Suspense Amazing Crime Thriller.",5
Badla,No nonsense only script with two brilliant actors!,5
Badla,"Badla : The film is a remake of hit Spanish thriller The Invisible Guest (2016)Badla starts off with Amitabh Bachchan's character Badal Gupta prepping for his case to save Naina Sethi from the murder charge. What starts then is an interesting, engaging, intriguing and tense ride.Naina Sethi (Taapsee Pannu) is accused of murdering her lover Arjun Joseph (Tony Luke). With everything going against her, she hires a lawyer, Badal Gupta (Amitabh Bachchan), who, in his 40 years of career, has never lost a case. The movie then follows the lawyer's investigation to find the truth amidst a web of lies.
Amitabh Bachchan is at the top of his game.Amrita Singh, for me, was the highlight of the film. I would specifically like to mention one scene when she meets Taapsee at a party, her performance in that particular scene will choke you.Taapsee Pannu is a complete natural.There are no songs in the film, which is a good thing as none was required. The background score is good and supports the movie well.The background score is good, the cinematography is beautiful and the editing is sharp. Dialogues are good and there is a tinge of humour in it, especially those spoken by Amitabh Bachchan's character.Badla keeps public at the edge of the seats which means Sujoy Ghosh has done a fab job.",4
Badla,"Badla is definitely an engrossing movie for viewers who have not seen the original. Badla is a scene by scene remake of the Spanish thriller ""The Invisible Guest"". The only difference is the protagonists are flipped. Having said that the movie still delivers and keeps the audience guessing.The positives of the movie are good acting by Amitabh Bachchan who keeps the spectators guessing with his screen presence and Amrita Singh as a suffering mother. Top notch cinematography and thankfully no songs. The movie moves with a good pace which is an essential requirement of a thriller.Sujoy Ghosh adapted screenplay and direction is good. Ghosh has done a fair job compared to other filmmakers who are blindly copying stories and remaking.Badla's weakest link is the main lead Tapsee Pannu who is not convincing in her act as a shrewd business woman. Rest of the characters also are not in finesse compared to the original movie.Though the original is a classic masterpiece and by no means I am comparing. Overall, a good watch for the audience who do not watch International cinema.
The bottom line is Bollywood movie makers need to be smart as Indian audience now have access to the International Cinema and they need to focus on original stories rather merely adapting from around the world.",4
Badla,"The most basic ingredient for a good movie, is a good story. Add to that Amitabh and Tapsee cast in good roles and delivering the best acting. And you have an edge of the seat thriller. Hard to find fault with this movie, and I looked hard....they only thing, maybe, was the very last part of the end maybe over the top...except the, really worth a watch!! 10/10",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Almost nine years we have waited for this dramatic conclusion. Was it worth it? Definitely!There are moments when watching this film that I thought that it was getting a little slow paced for me. However at the conclusion, I had come to appreciate every scene knowing that those scenes contributed greatly to the emotional ending.The movie itself continues with the journey of Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup is now chief but his focus is divided between looking after his people and the saving of dragons that are still threatened by humans outside of Berk. Hiccup embarks on a quest to find ""The Hidden World"", however he only has stories and few notes passed on from his father to go by. He believes that moving all dragons and his people to this mystical location will be the safest bet for their survival, given that Hiccup has made Berk an enemy of many tribes by raiding and saving dragons from those that do not mean well.As expected there is a new villain in this film by the name of Grimmel the Grisly. On a Villain meter this guy gets a solid 10. Cunning, ruthless, and hunter of dragons for the pure joy of it.As Toothless meets a new mate, Hiccup is faced with one of the hardest decisions of his life. However is it one that he is willing to make?How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is nothing short of a work of art. Is it the best movie in the series? I would say that it is on par with the others as each film captures the growth of Hiccup and the bond between himself and Toothless in a particular point in time. However I can say that this film is easily the most emotional.The supporting characters all play pivotal roles as Hiccup has grown to trust and rely on his dear friends over the course of the three films.This movie is great for all ages. Dreamworks have done a wonderful job in creating a timeless classic. I would strongly suggest watching the first two installments before watching this film.Signing offSilly D",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"I promise not to spoil the film below.
This film is both emotionally and visually beautiful. The film took a good five years to produce and you can see every second of it was put to good use. The plot is outstanding, and works perfectly as a third chapter for this trilogy. The character has completed some of the most outstanding growths in what I'd consider to be films as a whole. Getting to watch these characters grow from children to adults has been one of the most realistic experiences I've ever seen put to film. This movie is amazing, now go watch it!",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"You need to watch this movie 20 times! It's the epic conclusion of one of the greatest stories ever! You will cry at the end for sure! I had some problems the first 20 minutes with the script, it took some time to connect with the audience. But still the movie was amazing! Was emotional and had memorable moments!!! Best Dreamworks movie, and one of the best animations I've seen!",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Walking into this film I had very high expectations.The first movie, I'd watched when I was about 8 years old and I fell in love with the characters and the world behind Vikings and dragons. It was a movie in my childhood that I admired and loved, as well as the rest of my family.The second movie, I'd also watched in the cinema as soon as it came out and it also touched strings in my heart and I loved it as well. I was around 12. Though it didn't quite surpass it's predecessor, it was certainly at the same the level of brilliant animation and story-telling of ancient Norse culture and myths.Therefore this third movie needed to at least live up to the previous two, if not be better! And I was blown away with the phenomenal graphics, overall plot which was cleverly woven with both child and adult humour. It mixes enough action and battle scenes to get you hyped up, while making you laugh with great one-liners from each character, then it will fill your heart with beautifully choreographed animations of the dragon culture and the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, and it will even make you teary-eyed for the love of these characters.This movie especially, in my opinion, is one of the best animated movies (up there with Toy Story, Coco and Loving Vincent); not just because of the success the series had had - but I was overly impressed with the development of the characters and it almost feels as though I, myself, grew up alongside Hiccup, Toothless and the rest of Berk. From watching the first movie when I was 8, and watching the third and now I'm 16 - it really felt like a second home.This movie is absolutely incredible to watch for all audiences as it plays with important social and personal themes. The reason why it's not a 10/10 is because it made me cry so bad, I was sobbing even after I left the theatre!100% worth your money and I might even",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Yes I'm over 40, male, and I cried. I've taken my kids to all 3 movies, and we've loved all of them. I must admit, I was nervous going in after watching the diabolical Wreck it Ralph 2. Was this 2nd sequel going to finish on a high?
Absolutely, it didn't let me down. It had heart, it had a great story and an epic finish.
Dreamworks, you've out done pixar on this one, well done!",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"I went and saw this movie with my best friend and her two brothers today and I cannot stop thinking about it. It was the best way to end the franchise of my favourite movies since I was eight years old. I'm 17 now, and I still love it as much as I did then. It covers pretty much everything I hoped would happen.
A lot of this movie was focused mainly on Toothless instead of Hiccup and he makes a lot of the decisions in this movie that Hiccup might have made in the first two films. He is also being drawn away from Hiccup after meeting the Light Fury and Hiccup starts to discover who he is without his dragon and also focus on his relationship with Astrid. Both dragon and human make impossible decisions to save their kind.
This movie is very emotional and gives a different vibe to the first two films and includes everything a true HTTYD would want to see. The animation is absolutely amazing, especially in the scenes were Toothless and the Light Fury are falling in love. The soundtrack is also beautiful and fits in well with the scene. There is also good character development, especially for Hiccup and Toothless, of course, and we even see a little more of a significant role in a coupe of the characters we've always known to be comedic relief.
I was very happy with the final film in my favourite movie franchise, and I even cried a little bit in the last ten minutes. It is more dark and mature than the first two films and can therefore be loved by adults as well. Thank you so much, How to Train your Dragon franchise. You changed my life for the better.",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"This film is well executed , good movie but not impressed . Don't put high expectations on this film . A charming movie , not to be taken too seriously but ultimately very entertaining and sad . You really do need to learn how to train your dragon !!",3
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"With the first two full length features in the franchise being some of my favourite animated movies out there, I had high expectations going in; i was not disappointed at all. The visuals are stunning with a well performing cast, a goosebump-inducing musical score with touching yet satisfying final act that lives up to expectations in every way.
With the relationship between Hiccup & Toothless being the main focus of the saga, this film takes it to new heights and makes it the emotional drive of the story.
The animation is incredibly attentive and much more realistic; it shows how far DreamWorks have come since the franchise began back in 2010.
It contains numerous homages to the first film that will make all viewers laugh and cry alike.
Overall, a very pleasing and emotionally affecting end to the saga with a strong emotional message about friendship",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic finale for the film franchise and a poignant farewell to this beautiful realm of humans and dragons. Seeing these characters evolve over the past two films to where they are in The Hidden World feels not only believable but deeply emotional and weighty as well.The Hidden World takes place one year after the second film, which means there aren't as many massive changes like the five-year jump between How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2. While the main characters are still massive goofs, they also feel more like burgeoning adults now. Everyone's been riding, fighting, and living alongside their dragons for at least six years so they're a more capable bunch now (well, most of the time). Meanwhile, their home, Berk, has grown into a ridiculously overcrowded viking/dragon utopia.Hiccup's (Jay Baruchel) dragon-based tech has also continued to evolve and ties nicely back into the previous films. Seeing things like the wingsuit he was working on in the second movie be perfected in this third film gives the world a real physical sense of tangible continuity. Not all the film's callbacks work though. While the recurring jokes from the earlier movies -- such as how the twins hate each other, or Toothless playing fetch with Hiccup's foot -- were fun, they also felt forced and less genuine than before.
Now the village chief, Hiccup, more than any other character, has truly come into his own even though, in many ways, he's still that boy full of self-doubt and compassion for his people and their dragons. He still looks to his friends, and especially his partner Astrid (America Ferrara), for help and inspiration when times are tough or his confidence wavers. Astrid remains one of the most capable among the supporting characters, having taken on an almost second- in-command role in the village.A dangerous new threat to Berk comes in the form of the fearsome dragon tracker Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham). Grimmel is a truly fitting villain for this emotional final installment. Not only does Grimmel make things personal by having a special vendetta against Toothless, he's also strategic and calculating, always a step ahead of the heroes. He forces the citizens of Berk, particularly Hiccup and Toothless, to make some of their hardest sacrifices yet. Grimmel doesn't simply want power; he wants to totally eradicate dragons and make a larger, painful point while doing so. To this end, he uses the white female Night Fury dragon -- the Light Fury -- as bait to try to take out Toothless. Fortunately, the introduction of the Light Fury is simply adorable. The way the dragons move and behave like living, lovable creatures has always been essential to this franchise and this entry wisely doubled down on that hard.Hiccup's support for his friend during this time shows how far they've come together as a team. Usually, it's been Hiccup developing a new relationship (like discovering Toothless in the first film or meeting his mother in the second). This time it's Toothless's turn to forge a new relationship. The pivotal choice facing Hiccup here is one that the Hiccup from even one film ago wouldn't have had the strength to make. Indeed, none of the characters we met in the first movie would have been capable of what's required of them here. It took the total arc of three films to get them all here to such a believable and selfless conclusion.Visually, every installment in this trilogy has depicted a new dragon home, each one more magnificent than the last. The titular Hidden World is a haven for thousands of different kinds of dragons. These awe-inspiring scenes have so much happening on screen at once and wonderfully showcase just how far these films have evolved and improved visually since the 2010 original. Everything from scenes of destruction to dragon fire and dragon scales to the softness of human characters' hair all looked truly impressive. Factor in the rousing score and you have a movie that's a feast for the senses.The Verdict
How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic, visually stunning and poignant way to end this beloved trilogy. While the young characters remain joyously funny, this finale also adds mature notes to their story of friendship. The franchise has, like its audience, grown up, and to that end this film grapples with more complex themes than before, making for a truly satisfying yet bittersweet conclusion.",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"I love this movie as much as I loved The first two
The soundtrack is amazing (John Powell is genius)
The animation is absolutely gorgeous every scene looked so real and magical (this is the best animated film)
The friendship that hiccup and toothless have is so beautiful and I love them so much
Toothless and the light fury is so cute and adorable I love the scenes when they are together
Hiccup and Astrid relationship is awesome too I love how Much Astrid loves hiccup and how she always going to be by his side
I'm glad that the twins (ruffnut and tuffnut) got to be in some of scenes
I love ruffnut she is so funny
And the ending is beautiful it is so perfect
What an amazing way to end the the httyd Trilogy
Thank you to dean deblois,Cressida cowell,John Powell, and everyone at dreamworks who help made the httyd movies and series",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"This is the most beautiful and amazing movie of all time!!! Even I can say that this movie is better than its previous ones, and it's much to say. I've never cried so much with a movie... It can't be better ending for this trilogy. These movies have become my life and now that all is ended, I don't know what will be of me...I don't understand why DreamWorks Animation is so underrated, so Disney is not always good making movies. DWA deserves the same attention than Disney, just saying that my favorite movies are from DWA.I need this movie win an Oscar because they deserve a lot since the first one, and because I want everyone see the perfect and awesome these movies are. So, they are the better of this generation. These movies will always be in my heart, and they will be my favorite FOREVER.",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"I went in How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World with high expectations. I knew this was going to be the final movie of the trilogy so reasonably I thought yeah it's going to be entertaining at least. I came out a little underwhelmed. My biggest issue with the movie is that it rehashes similar themes and scenes of the first two that it didn't impress me nearly as much. Yeah, the animation is fantastic and I love
the score by John Powell, but it just feels like a very standard sequel. How to Train Your Dragon 2 took risks and got surprisingly dark in places. This one, it focuses mostly on a pretty forgettable villain and Toothless' love interest, who is bland and nowhere near as memorable. The humour didn't work as well for me and seemed more kiddy-ish compared to the previous two. Everything felt safer and generic.Despite all this, I never found the movie boring and still enjoyed it. I appreciate that the writers and animators have been growing up the characters as time goes by, and Hiccup and the others having to decide what to do with their Dragons and not always relying on them was a nice theme of the movie. Hiccup and Toothless interacting with each other is always a highlight, and the action sequences are well shot and colourful as expected. The last 10 minutes were great, as I really liked all the characters having a big final send-off and concluding the entire trilogy nicely. It almost got to me, honestly. I just wished the main plot was a bit more engaging and not stuff we're already seen before. On the upside, it wasn't bad at least.6.5/10",4
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,The animation is amazing. The story is unique. A less obvious conclusion and the best characters ever. Definately recommended.Even adults will be laughing throughout the entire thing.,5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,How to train your dragon is amazing and the hidden world is even more so. Can't wait till I can buy it on DVD and watch it a million times.,5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"No spoilers hereWhat I can say is this the trailers don't do the movie justice. It's sad to see this awesome and wonderful journey come to a conclusion but it is the right time, It's both got heart and love yes most movies have love but this was more then just love. Don't let others decide the movie for you go watch it and see the amazing world of dragons and the hidden world you will not be disappointedMy review is this 1000/1000",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is the third and final film in the trilogy, which in every way is the best of the 3, While taking a different tone the film itself feels more grown up along with its characters, this time around having a much more fleshed out world that seems lived in and real while also being an amazing character piece that deals with many heavier issues than is displayed in the trailers released, which should not be watched by ANYONE who doesn't want to know what happens before they see it. With a more thought out and thorough script and an amazing jump in visuals and story telling How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a staple in animation while being a heartwarming and tear jerking send off to our beloved characters.",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"The much awaited finale to the dragon saga is here but it doesn't fulfil ones expectations. The visuals are stunning, much better than the previous films. Animation is spot on. The movie is filled with innumerable, vibrant, variegated, goliath dragons each with their eccentric ability. The scene where the hidden world is introduced is absolutely breathtaking, visually and with the synced soundtrack. One could simply re-watch that scene over and over and never get bored. Although the film has much of the fun and frolic to rejoice about, it still denies to deliver something new. There is alot in their basket but only a few things executed. Too many characters introduced but only a few are given the spotlight. The plot isn't that good, it lacks originality and could be better. Much of the story is centered around the chemistry between night fury and light fury, depicted in a rather Bollywood style, consuming much of the film's runtime. Humor is facetious. The purpose of the villian, to be the villian is not very convincing. Most fighting will give u an epiphany, with a question ""couldn't they have done this before?"" The film feels like the director focused too much on finishing the saga with a sentimental ending and failed to pay attention to the paramount part of the film - ""the storyline"". When juxtaposing this film to its predecessors I believe that httyd 1 is by far the best, regarding its content...followed by httyd 2 and then httyd3.
Animation - 8/10
Visuals - 8/10
Action - 7/10
Humour - 6/10
Storyline - 6/10",4
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"First of all, let me start by pointing out the following: the fact that the ending of a movie moves you to tears, doesn't make it WOW THE MOST AMAZING MOVIE OF ALL TIME.
I am a huge fan of the franchise but this movie was a huge let-down. I agree with the criticism I've already read on this page. Story underdeveloped, the villain extremely underwhelming... The whole movie is basically shown in the trailer. Sure, I had a tear in my eye when the dragons leave at the end, but hey, it's toothless and Hiccup... The hidden world only seems to be a few miles away from the island and is accessed through a simple waterfall and a cave. Why then can't the dragons just move there, safely out of the way, but come and visit sometimes? Why do they suddenly turn savage? Why does Toothless go away and just leave Hiccup behind, without saying goodbye, when last movie he would have given his own life to save him? Just a lot of loose ends and irregularities, really. Very dissappointing.",3
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Some of these 10 star reviews must be fake. I LOVED the other movies in this series, but this one was pretty boring.It wasn't horrible, but I felt so indifferent to the characters and the plot whereas the first few I felt really invested.It felt much more ""kiddish"" and less character depth.",3
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Dreamworks has done it agin. I can't explain enough how brilliant the movie was, it's perfect, and that's definitely an understatement",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"First, I'd like to say that I am a HUGE HTTYD fan (I even have a Toothless tattoo and a massive collection of HTTYD merch!), but this film just left me feeling disappointed.The good:
The animation was STUNNING. By far the most gorgeously rendered animated film I have ever seen.The voice acting was stellar. Jay Baruchel killed it again, and the villain was phenomenally done.This film had some of the best humor of the films.The bad:
The story itself was very boring. The movie ended up feeling longer than it was, and it never seemed to find its momentum.-The way the story was told was fragmented and choppy.
They tried to cram too much in, so nothing got the time it needed/deserved. Every storyline felt rushed and empty.The whole movie was centered around the writer/director's need for a gut-punch ending...A fact that robbed the movie of any greatness it could have had. The vision was lost and the focus was off. Instead of a magnificent film (like the first two), it played out more like someone's bad fanfiction.The relationships that were built in the first two films and the shows were all but ignored in this movie. Most especially the relationships between Toothless/Hiccup, as well as Hiccup/Astrid. I felt like what we saw in this film only served to ruin what the past films had created. Examples: Toothless basically abandons Hiccup without saying goodbye at one point in the film and ONLY comes back to Hiccup through necessity (to save Hiccup and Astrid when they enter the Hidden World). Toothless ultimately abandons Hiccup for a dragon he doesn't know - which is not at all in line with the Toothless from the first two films OR the TV series. Astrid refuses Hiccup's hand in marriage several times, and it actually feels like she doesn't care for him.The score for this movie was the weakest of the trilogy. The only shining moments were call-backs to the original soundtrack.The villain is wasted. Even in scenes that you know are supposed to be suspenseful, you're left feeling bored.The ending didn't feel right. As someone who LOVES these movies - probably more than anyone - the fact that I didn't cry when the dragons left was a huge deal. I felt nothing.In the end, you leave the theatre feeling punished rather than rewarded.Ultimately, this film weakened the trilogy as a whole. It even managed to cool my nearly decade-long rabid love for the franchise. And though I will always consider the first film to be my all-time favorite movie, The Hidden World will remain one of my greatest film disappointments.",2
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"What a gorgeous movie! They just got it right. Everyone needs a friendship like that in life and we all need a reminder of love is loss.
A heartwarming story and hilarious scenes. Heros and kings are men and men a just dumber than women, the girls always save the day!!!!
And boys, the best way to impress a lady is not to dance (please!) just be yourself, do what you love most - or just draw your silly face like Toothless. She will like that!
The attention to details is just spot on showing equality in every little bit ie how Hiccup's children are featured and how they swapped kids so both can have a ride. And how the boy is just a little more sensitive than the girl. Love how they kept Hiccup & Toothless disabilities and turn them into their strength. Great lessons kids and grown-ups!!!
Also Toothless was the last one to leave, sentiments and all but also shown that he was a true leader. The leader of the pack like in wolves always the last one to watch out for the rest.
The only thing is that Toothless love story took most screentime so not much was said about the villain but, do we complain? Absolutely not!
Fly on your own Hiccup!",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"'How to train the dragon 3' - the film completes the huge history of Icking, Bezzubik and the whole island 'Alkh "". Each of the parts of the trilogy is focused on a specific topic. The first film was about the main character's growing up, the second one was about true friendship, and the third one touches on the theme of love, both between Icking and Astrid, and between Bezzubik and the new character - Day Fury.
A new danger is looming on the swindle. Professional dragon hunter that has sworn to destroy all the Furies. Hiccup has the toughest fight to do and has to make the toughest decision in its life.The film is almost not different from the previous parts. He stands out against their background, perhaps, with an incredibly touching ending, which the viewer is able to unravel after twenty minutes of the film, but even despite its predictability, you are still touched and let a tear like a child say goodbye to your favorite characters.
Awesome humor. The most serious spectator will somehow laugh from one or another joke whether she is from Smorkly, Bully or Zadarak. Warm, sincere atmosphere of the world of the most different dragons - good and bad. The only thing that can be taken as a minus is the main villain. It is in the background and is needed only as a threat and the beinning of a new part.
I admit, I love each part a lot and it is difficult for me to say goodbye, as it will be difficult for all other fans, but the last thing I would like to do is admit that I can safely name the trilogy 'How to Train Your Dragon' one of the best trilogy modern cinema. Each movie is interesting, each character falls in love with himself, and the end makes him say: 'Thank you'. And is this not a good movie?",4
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"This is literally dreamworks's masterpiece, no need to explain further...",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Felt a very rushed ending to the trilogy. Sound track was non existent. Barely any humour. What also bugs me is that there is no clarification what species light fury is?! The director claimed that light furys are a sub species but Grimmel says i have a female and they mate for life but also In the same conversation he killed all the night furys, would it of killed them to clarify it even in a flashback, they had time to add another two lightfurys in the hiddenworld scene. Niether hiccup or astrid mention any differences infact notice her straight away as a female. The uae of the flashbacks, tho needed for the story they seemed rather random in there placement.
Seems rather rushed not finished as it should be still leaves me with answers, did they settle on the bew island? Go back to berk? Is grimmel actually dead? What about the dragon trappers? What about the other dragon riders in the series, do they give up there dragons too? Why are the babies miss marked colour?",3
Super Deluxe,"#SuperDeluxe - This is a strict A film. Not like IAMK type but something that is very new to tamil cinema. The film is so dark because these characters are so real and it's like meeting someone you'll never meet in ordinary life. Director #ThiagarajanKumararaja, he deserves a standing ovation for writing this masterpiece, the screenplay is a high point. Maybe he'll be Kollywood's best known Screen writer.The background set, Cinematography is all just so perfect. No compromises made anywhere.Coming on to #Samantha, she made a terrific role. Her second lifetime best role, first is always Nithya from #NEP. #VijaySethupathy has nothing to prove here, we already know what he is. #FahadhFaasil, #Bucks, #Mysskin, small boy, 5 youngesters all gave a wonderful performance.Overall, I would give Super Deluxe an Oscar if I was part of Jury for it's unconventional story line, something we have never seen in Tamil Cinema. The low point is, it won't work with all of the Tamil audiences. I have a friend who diagrees with all my points and says that 'Super Deluxe' has too many unclutural, uncomfortable scenes or dialogs involved. The problem is that the film is way ahead of our time.But in the end of the day, a film should either be Art or Entertainment. This is Artainment. This is new, this is very new with Tamil Cinema. I enjoyed every frame of this masterpiece. I cannot guarantee you the same, it depends on how you react when your best friend breaks your brand new TV for seeing something awful in it. So, go and experience this yourself.",5
Super Deluxe,"Thiagarajan Kumararaja has conveyed and compiled so many messages as much as possible in a movie. I am sure the might have forced to have omitted few messages due to the length of the movie.How do you feel when you have something to say to the world and it displayed in the form of a movie, it was such a kind of a movie.It is not easy to direct such movies without the influence of a higher intellectual.It is high time people change their perception and start accepting realities in life.Life is very simple, we spoil it because of our very own thoughts and deeds.This movie is to all those who have the ability to perceive and be receptive to adapt a new life. You realise life, because you are alive !!!",5
Super Deluxe,Never seen this kind of movie. This movie will touch every Genre of movie style.,5
Super Deluxe,"Masterpiece would be the perfect word to describe this cult movie. It holds you with curiosity until the last-minute and creates a great impact. All actors have played their part so well that they stay in our mind as characters of the film. Vijay sethupathi as Shilpa, he has given an extraordinary performance as usual. Samantha as Vembu proves that she is a star performer. The end voice over philosophy creates a greater impact and connects all the important dialogues in the movie which points to message that the director tries to conveys to the audience. Thiagarajan Kumararaja deserves National Award! Close to 3 hours movie without songs must watch guys!",5
Super Deluxe,"The movie sets the ball rolling big time even as the credits come on. Then the background music makes it's entry and then the first scene comes on, and you know, you are in the right theater.The deep saturated colors in the frames feel so perfect. The frames are simply perfect - framing characters in different portions of the screen, amazing.There are so many scenes that are so hilarious. The screenplay has a welcome randomness to it. You typically never know what is coming.Vijay Sethupathi is on a push-the-envelope mode. While the old man in Aadhi was challenging, the transgender in Super-Deluxe is a level up in challenge and well met.Fahad Fazil, on the other hand, did not have a better role here than say ""Kumbalangi Nights"". Some of his scenes almost did not work, while many others did.Bagavathi Perumal, who plays the subinspector has given a truly outstanding performance, potentially surpassed only by Vijay Sethupathi, who had the advantage of much more challenging scenes.Yuvan Shankar Raja has done amazing background music work, that stands out with it's subduedness. Music is used to enhance comedy at multiple points, and the result has been fantastic. Also, unique sound choices to communicate scene tension, background sounds to give a feel of a lot of background action.Multiple unpredictable random threads of stories sometimes come together in such a sudden tight knot that you can almost touch. Randomness is just awesome.The thread on god did not connect with me and hence, scenes on that thread, felt like a drag, as also did some scenes of Fahadh.Deeply philosophical as well, the movie presents various valid stands. I did not quite like the ending as much, as it was a bit preachy. On the other hand, leaving it abstract might not communicate enough.A must watch and more. Worthy of multiple watches for sure.",5
Super Deluxe,"Yet again thiagarajan kumaraja proved he is king in story telling. Starting from story, props, visual, BGM and every actor role were apt and movie is definitely worth watch for more than once !",5
Super Deluxe,The Complete Unit deserves an Applaud. I would not mind watching it again and again.,5
Super Deluxe,The movie revolves around many character but the beauty is that we can connect to all ... Music is a Bonus to the film..... Each actor as eaten each other by their acting ...simply and admirable cinematography ...... Deals with many problems and a most wanted message ......,5
Super Deluxe,"Out of the world , no words to describe , this movie will definitely discover a completely new term/genre.Only a person who breathes cinema can create this. amazing actors , performances , and gripping scenes , fabulous screenplay proving all film directors and cinematographers that screenplay can also be made this way.Perfect details , shots , every shot makes us travel through the journey of the characters in the film , that intense , the choice of shots would be very normal but details in each of the shots conveyed a lot of stories establishing the connect and reality .Treat for cinema lovers!!",5
Super Deluxe,"If you are expecting tamil cinema to reach its highest limits, watch this movie and you will definitely find the tamil industry already reached beyond its limits. It is a pure and raw form of tamil film. I don't think anyone can cross this limits in future except Thiyagraja. perfect screenplay and script work. he deserves more than a national award for making such an exotdinary film. He shifted the whole industry to the next level with his unique and raw style. Completely satisfied.",5
Super Deluxe,"Everything that happens around us can be law of causation or absolute miracle. It depends on that individual's conscience and perspective. This movie is about a dozen of such characters with absolutely varied levels of understanding and approach towards life and the people around them. Series of events that happens to them and how they react to it.Movie is filled with unexpected circumstances, honest and innocent reactions, and deep thoughts cracked very lightly. At several places, director mocks at us (the society) while making us laugh at our own stupidity, tolerance-to-injustice, misaligned-priorities, overseeing the obvious and several other essential aspects of co-existence.People with conservative mindset will not be able to ingest the fact that ""When the wife confesses she just slept with someone; the husband, though angry, takes it pretty lightly"". Understandable. But it is an undeniable fact that the women of their household too, must have at-least fantasized about someone else and their chastity is mostly circumstantial.It is for intelligent minds interested in researching and seeking amendments in social science and soul searching. If you are tired day-in-day-out crunching numbers, logics and dealing with other's insecurities and wanted to break-free with a rom-com (romantic-comedy), please stay far away from it. :)",5
Super Deluxe,Just get into Kumararaja's world..take the ride.. and get the experience..,4
Super Deluxe,"No doubt Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Super Deluxe is one of the masterpiece and the cult classic film in Tamil. The moment I saw the posters of Park Chan-wook's Sympathy for Vengeance, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and a picture of David Lynch at the DVD Rental store in the film, I was sold, that's when I thought this is going to be full paisa vasool padam. You're getting a full package of four Film (since it has four different story) wrapped and served on a platter.In one of the interview Thiagarajan Kumararaja said he's afraid to write and he's lazy. Seriously...? When he can create wonders like Aaranya Kaandam and Super Deluxe when he's afraid and lazy, just wonder what would be the outcome if he's not lazy or afraid.Take a bow to the writers - Kumararaja, Mysskin, Nalan Kumarasamy and Neelan K. Sekhar for crafting such a phenomenal story across their views on life, relationships, love, sex and spirituality. And an extra effort made by Kumararaja to hyperlink those stories along With Idiosyncratic and Palpable characters.Samantha as Vaembu, is one heck of a performance. For the fact, she wasn't the first choice for the character, many leading actresses had turned down playing Vaembu. And now I can say, no one else could have done it better than Sam, she's irreplaceable.And our very own Makkal Selvan Vijay Sethupathi playing the transgender women Shilpa, the episodes between him and his son Rasukutty (Ashwanth Ashokkumar) Was so pure, for sure you will fall in love with that kid. Bagavathi Perumal as SI Berlin is one character where the audience will feel like thrashing him, Shilpa-Berlin and Vaembu-Berlin scenes, will definitely fill the rage in the eyes of the audience for its own reasons. Leela's (Ramya Krishnan) dialogue towards the end of the climax, will definitely hit you hard.Fahadh Faasil as Mugilan, Mysskin as Arputham, Gayathrie as Jyothi and the four kids. You will witness some awe-inspiring performance by each and everyone, proving their caliber. Even the minor characters, has done some stupendous job in acting.Once you understand Kumararaja, the same lengthy and boring scenes will now slowly transit to an interesting setting. Vinod and Nirav Shah cinematography elevates the story, the color pattern, the unconventional camera angles, along with the crisp editing by Sathyaraj Natarajan, I was spellbound.If you've already validated 'Rowdy Baby' as Yuvan Shankar Raja best in career in terms of its quality treatment and popularity, then you must Watch Super Deluxe. As they say, there's something more than that meets the eye, U1 's sound design techniques is one among that. Every minute detail that you witness in his background scoring along with Illaiyaraja songs, is something which can be considered as the added bonus to your paisa vasool ticket. And the ride ends with the compelling climax.If one can even enjoy the steady frame for more than 8 seconds and the silence within that. Then it has to be Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Film.",4
Super Deluxe,"Am not going to tell you to watch this movie..
But do watch this movie for different experience..",4
Super Deluxe,"A must watch movie in recent days. What a movie making man. Cinematography is another level; Every shot is like a painting; Camera angles are highly innovative. The background score is equally well made. Hats off to the whole team, you nailed it!",5
Super Deluxe,"Multiple different stories, messages, narrations at times can drag the movie way more than required and kind of becomes pointless at times. Its good in ""many"" aspects, but that ""many"" aspects kind of could have been few and made equal impact. Though really kudos to all actors and Director to bring a great movie.",4
Super Deluxe,"Never have I seen a portrayal of social stigmas in a commercial movie. Great effort by the director in his second movie. UFO, Sex change, Adultery, power plays, beliefs, youth exploitation, you name it... Lucidly portrayed with a star cast brave enough to rough it out and perform so naturally.",5
Super Deluxe,I hope this film will reach to every people in the world. I have never 'EXPERIENCED' this kind of a Drama. What You need? They have everything you need. Background score is amazing by Yuvan Shankar Raja. Each and everyone's acting is tooo good. This film is a totally hard-hitting Masterpiece I have never seen so far.,5
Super Deluxe,"A movie that causes you to continuously analyze every single event and figure out the importance of it definitely has to be Super Deluxe. With 3 narratives that are showed simultaneously telling amazing stories that are somehow interlinked. Super deluxe also includes many amazing performances from all cast members and also has many confusing moments that will make you think. Kumararaja believes his audience is intelligent by making such a complex movie for his viewers. This is definitely a must watch film and is revolutionary movie for Tamil cinema.Spoiler
Alien explanation:
Based on the overall message of the movie, it seems that the inclusion of the alien scene was to convey that all people are not unique since society fears the people that are different. The alien states that her former best friend has died 2 minutes earlier but she didn't shed a tear because she was able to find a replacement that was the same since everyone on earth is unique. This ties in well with the story since Shilpa says to her son that don't be unique because society will reject you.",5
Super Deluxe,"Anybody who is into any form of self enquiry, whether it pertains to the traditional system of Yoga or the newly and infinitely synthesized ways from the mind would resonate deeply with this film. Hats off and a standing ovation to each and every person who made this film possible. I am definitely getting a blue ray physical copy and preserving it for life.",5
Super Deluxe,People will begin understand that there is nothing right or wrong in this world. It is just perfect the way it is and the way it is going.,5
Super Deluxe,Tamil movie industry is definitely in good form. Coming up with bold and beautiful films. Super deluxe is another amazing movie from the industry. I would have give 9 star but the director dragged many scenes and made it in to a 3 hours and I don't know why. There are many scenes you will feel bored. Yet a film you should go and watch in theater for its beautiful images. Director used mostly Dark blue and red and it was amazing.,3
Super Deluxe,"A couple try to dispose a dead body; a little boy gets a surprise when he meets his estranged father; a son discovers his mother's other side; a religious man starts having doubts over his God... What connects these four stories?
Super Deluxe gives us four stories and the protagonists in each of these stories are tested in their beliefs in the strangest ways. For the married couple Vembu (Samantha) and Mukil (Fahadh Faasil), the situation in which they get into is a test of their marital relationship. It is a test of her love for her son for Shilpa (Vijay Sethupathi), a transgender who has come back to her family. For Arputham (Mysskin), who has survived the tsunami and found a new God, and Leela (Ramya Krishnan), a former porn star who is desperately trying to save her injured son, Soori, it is a test of their belief in God and humanity respectively. And there are also three lads who face a literal test of bravery.Giving out anything more about the plot of Super Deluxe will ruin the fun and joy of experiencing something singularly unique. There is a heartless and horny cop, a quirky don, a publicity crazy politician, a greedy doctor, unwanted neighbours, a loyal Man Friday, and more in this crazy world that Thiagarajan Kumararaja has come up with. The performances are first-rate all around. Vijay Sethupathi's Shilpa is a new high for the actor, while Fahadh and Samantha are instantly likeable. Mysskin and Ramya Krishnan are solid while the gang of boys are great finds. Then, there is Ashwath, who wins our hearts, and a cast-against-type Bhagavathi Perumal, who makes us want to murder him. There is black comedy, double entendres, swear words, WTF moments, political and social commentary, romance, sentiment and even a musing on what it means to be life on Earth. There is ambition, genius, and also a beating heart.",5
Captain Marvel,"The character development is very spotty until the end of this movie. But even then, you don't get a big ""aha"" moment. Brie Larson is underwhelming, which is unfortunate because she is such a good actress. She came off stiff throughout the whole movie. To be fair, I have not read the comic books. So it's possible someone who knew the characters could appreciate this movie more. Otherwise, it's in the bottom 5 Marvel Universe movies.",2
Captain Marvel,"There are a lot of problems with this movie. Apart from the fact that the main character is not interesting at all, she is way too powerful and she doesn't even appear to have any weaknesses. For the love of Thanos: her name isn't even Captain Marvel... Mar-Vell is a completely different person in the movie! This movie tried so hard to copy other movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, and Captain America (I even noticed multiple similarities with Man of Steel) that it forgot to be a movie of itself. They tried to find as many connections to the MCU-timeline as possible, just tso they can cram in yet another superhero into their stuffed universe. I sincerely hope that this super-heroine doesn't spoil the final Avengers film.",2
Captain Marvel,"The film Captain Marvel, has a well designed script, but the film leaves something to be desired. In it tells the story of a very powerful heroine without many connections with the other universes of Marvel, begins with some scenes without senses, but in the course of the film these scenes fit, after its arrival to Earth its past and present fuse and stay more interesting after she finds out who one day she was.
In the end, it's the usual, that everyone expected of the heroine, she's extremely strong and with a very clichd power in my opinion, and with that enormous power makes the other characters almost useless compared to the strength of Carol Danvers in the end. she goes to the space in search of something, logically this film is an introduction to the other films of Marvel.
I thought that even with a lot of amazing effects, all the editing work they did, they still want a bit of the script, and they forced it to look like one of Marvel's strongest characters and still have the problem with actors of expressions on their faces that left the film a little without the emotions since the Marvel films usually leave their viewers full of emotion, this film could have been better with more time for preparation of actors and actresses, or new actors, I I really feel like throwing money in the trash to watch such a horrible movie, I love all the other Marvel movies, but this movie I will never watch again.",2
Captain Marvel,"It honestly felt like something that was thrown together.
1) I don't feel connected with the main character in fact I cared more about the Australian alien character than i did with the actual character
2)The movie feels overtly repetitive. Its basically a replay of ""oh you can't do this"" *Proves them wrong"" rinse and repeat this several times in one film and then you've got Captain Marvel. I don't even know what the goal of the movie was? What was even the challenge? They make her overly seem OP and the lack of struggle in the film. Apparently its literally just that she was already OP and had some amnesia she just had to remember what kind of lesson is that?? At least in Guardians of Galaxy these characters had eminent flaws in the film.
3) The moral seems to be ""she was right all along"" etc etc.
4) The end of the movie. What? The Jude Law fight she just cheats great so not only was there no character arc this whole movie is just one straight line.WE DO NOT SEE HER STRUGGLES!! The super Saiyan moment in the movie does not feel earned. Its literally just an overpowered characters that make you question the whole Avenger series. The Chitari moment wasn't an emergency???
Even better a character that I'm not emotionally invest in is the genesis of the Avengers? Yawwwn.If Lawson gave her powers then why wouldn't they show it. It would make me more emotionally invested. The script didn't help either.",2
Captain Marvel,"This movie has been the worst Marvel I have ever watch. This movie was over hyped.
We deserve a good movie.",2
Captain Marvel,"Contains spoiler... contains spoiler...contains spoilerVery weak main character. That sums it all up. She became the strongest being in the universe because ...? Just because they need a strong woman, who looks like the supermen. The vision had an infinity stone on its head that was made by the Earth's brightest minds and it was nothing against the Thanos. Captain Marvel could not even beat her own trainer, she just had a little blast near her and that's it. It does not make any sense. The sky opens and the aliens appear like no water in Avengers 1. Artificial Intelligence tries to take over the Avengers 2. They could have called her at any time, but no. They just have to force some hero to have nothing in the Ultimatum, which spoils the entire movie and what the Marvel Universe has built all this time

Captain Marvel,"The main problem in this film was Brie Larson, really. Terrible actress, no charm or carism and she don't know how to fight. Brings Iron Fist series to my memory.
Valkyre was better as fighter than this version of Carol Denvers.
This is a film about a woman who want to prove for the wolrd he is capable. That's it. But ironically, there is no moment that she deserves this power at all.
The Marvel Universe was in second plane. Sad.
Sorry, she can't be the main character on this second phase of MCU, if yes, i think we will have a stranger years in the future.",2
Captain Marvel,We're all going to watch their movies either way. It's actually a pretty entertaining movie but doesn't make a lot of sense.,1
Captain Marvel,"Just got home from seeing the movie and immediately told all my fellow MCU fans they need to see it. Then I hop on here and see negative review after negative review and I disagree with most of them! Feels like I was in a different movie!
Only thing I will agree with was bad is the fact that we don't know of a Captain Marvel weakness. She's insanely overpowered. But I mean, so is Scarlet Witch if you think about it. Scarlet Witch could take down any of the Avengers if she wanted to. And she sorta did, in Ultron when she was making all of them see their worst fears. (By the way why has she not done that since that movie? But that's besides the point) The only weakness Scarlet Witch has/had was her love for Vision. But that wasn't introduced until later in her story. So I don't think it's bad that we don't know Captain Marvel's weakness yet. This is the MCU, she will have more storyline, this was just setting up for more to come.
I actually think Brie Larson's acting was great. We learn very early in the movie that her character's being trained to control her emotions and impulses. That's the only thing she knows as she has no prior memories. Of course she's a little flat because of that. But then I find her character builds and develops as now she has the powers to match her confidence and ambition which gives her even more purpose. She starts regaining her memories and you can see her unfold as she feels love her old friend and the daughter. She stands up against the Kree people who she used to trust and shows them she's better off without them. She gives the Skrulls a chance and ends up fighting for them, and giving up her renewed life on earth for them. I find her to be a very different character towards the end than she is in the beginning.
Do people keep forgetting that this movie takes place in the 90's? This was an early beginning story for both Fury and Coulson. Neither of them have gone through any of the crap they soon will so I think it's well done that their characters were quite different. They will develop with time. If you watch this movie, then all the other Marvel movies in chronological order, it'd be more clear. They also joke that Coulson is the ""new guy"", which to me explains his slightly timid attitude.
I went into this movie trying to not let the politics affect my opinion. If you go into the movie already with a bad taste in your mouth, you might be disappointed. And I in no way support some of the things Brie Larson has said and done. But I don't find that any of that was brought into the movie and I am capable of letting those two instances be separate. I don't have to love and support every actor/actress in a movie in order to love the movie.
I am a female in my mid-20's and I felt very empowered by this movie. My 29-year-old brother felt empowered. I feel like this movie is intended to be motivational for all audiences and doesn't try to tear anyone down.
Goose was amazing and adorable up until he eats the bad guys. That was weird and uncomfortable to me but ok. Still love Goose!
Is it the best Marvel has done? No. But I am overall very pleased with the movie and will be seeing it again and again.
I just wish it gave us more teasers towards the rest of the Avengers and Endgame but I guess I can wait another month for that! If I have to!",4
Captain Marvel,Brie Larson looks like a middle aged housewife who is permanently constipated. Her character is as flat as her behind. Whoever thought she was the right fit should be fired. Ah well. The Marvel movies were good once. But all good things must come to an end I guess. And Captain Marvel is the end. Adieu MCU.,1
Captain Marvel,"A very lukewarm and silly movie. Looks like they just followed an easy recipe for an origin story. Also, it looks like they fell once again into the trap of making it a comic relief. I really hope Captain Marvel's presence is somewhat redeemed in Avengers: Endgame.",2
Captain Marvel,"I feel like this movie could have been a better one with a better writers team and the main actor. It seems like Brie Larson was not the best choice to play the role of captain marvel with the lackluster acting as well as the simply dull storyline that this movie followed through. It may also have been the hype that has been built for this movie but regardless, very disappointed in the movie overall.",1
Captain Marvel,"Trick question! It's all of the above. I thought Twilight had the monopoly on actresses who choose not to act. I was so wrong.Fight scenes: mediocre. The early fight between her and a bunch of skrulls while her hands were bound was cool, but immediately subverted by the fact that she deus ex machina'd her way out of her bonds with no meaningful struggle whatsoever. Everything else was just the same fight over and over - Carol fights, miraculously gets stronger (or is obviously stronger than her enemy to begin with), and defeats her opponent without so much as breaking a sweat. Or a smile. Or any expression at all, really.VFX: poor. Expected a hell of a lot better from a marvel movie that the studio has put so much effort into promoting as the new face of the franchise. The skrulls transforming made people in my theatre laugh. Carol's fight at the end was so CGI, it made the CGI in The Last Jedi look good by comparison. A mess, really.Writing: a garbage fire, I wish I was being harsh. I cannot express with more vehemence how disappointed I am in the writing of both the script and, most importantly, Carol Danvers herself. There is not a character in the MCU right now with a flatter arc than Carol. Even pre-ragnarok Thor had more emotional depth to him. For Carol to be so lacking in substance is unforgivable. I'm a young woman. I AM the audience Captain Marvel was allegedly written for. So why, then, can I relate to Nicholas Joseph Fury more in this movie than I can the PROTAGONIST? Its such god awful writing I was and still am astounded by the positive reviews it gets concerning its characterization. No, the Kree instructing her to show less emotion ISN'T an excuse when she is blatantly unaffected by the training from the very beginning of the movie. Literally her first on-screen appearance is to defy her mentor's wishes for her to be more emotionally inert. She clearly isn't buying what they're selling, so that rationalization for lack of emotion is absolute BS. Nothing connects. Nothing links up. It's a script in shambles. Carol has done nothing particularly impressive by the end (and no, having amazing powers does not count when she does not have the emotional journey to make those powers a fulfilling end to her story re: Thor, Steve, Wanda), certainly doesn't deserve to be called the ""original Avenger"" considering how little she actually had to do with Fury himself (calling them the Goose Initiative would have made more sense in the context of the film), and isn't overall going to be a great addition to Endgame if this move is anything to judge by. She has faced none of the emotional toil that the other Avengers have. She's less experienced in this regard than even Spider-man. If she is written in Endgame as wise-cracking and unaffected as she is in her own movie, she's liable to actually ruin conclusion of the MCU's greatest characters considering how disproportionately powerful the writers have made her here. Luckily I have some faith in the Russo brothers, so here's hoping they salvage something from her terrible debut movie to put in Endgame. Something with a tad more heart than Captain Marvel is currently shown to have.Acting: look, I really don't know what kind of script Brie Larson was dealt. It seems to have been horrendously awful in her defense. Nonetheless, Samuel L Jackson, Ben Mendelson, and Lashana Lynch all managed to breathe some life into their roles. Larson is the MCU's Kristen Stewart at present. I did not see a single meaningful expression on her face the entire movie. Not genuine excitement, happiness, frustration, sadness, nothing. She was so wooden it was painful. I felt nothing for her because she felt nothing. And I really can't tell if it's because the script wrote her as such or because Brie Larson flubbed it. I really can't. Perhaps it's some unholy combination of the two. Either way, yikes.tl;dr what else there is to say. This movie was god-awful. I liked Goose. And yet even then, goose being the one who cost fury his eye is... about as underwhelming as the rest of the film, I'd say. People saw this movie because it's a set-up for Endgame, myself included. That's all there is to it.",1
Captain Marvel,I'm confused at the 7.2 star rating... it was just a bland movie overall,1
Captain Marvel,"This movie made a lot of money because it's a Marvel movie. It's integrated in the MCU so everyone who's invested their time in all these movies are gonna see it. That right there makes it a crap ton of money. But in story wise, acting, and yes, comic lore, it doesn't deliver. Brie Larson played the whole movie with one emotion. The music selection for the fight scenes just deflated them. And she is not Captain Marvel. She is someone who decided to take up the mantle of Captain Marvel. Binary/Ms.Marvel, everything went to the wayside so Marvel could push their feminist agenda and it's definitely felt. ""I'm just a girl"" by No Doubt playing during the fight scene was absurd. Throughout the movie Carol seemed like a pouty brat with that ""I don't have anything to prove, I'm a woman"" attitude. Let's create a quick origin that an alien spaceship exploded and she absorbed it and now she's unstoppable. Yes. Let's do that so we can get right down to Hey we have a Superwoman now. If you take what this movie has brought into the MCU, then Endgame should be done in 5 minutes. They will find Thanos and she will come in and frown and blast him and scream I am woman, hear me roar. End scene.",1
Captain Marvel,Probably the worst movie from Marvel. Very slow pace and doesn't do justice to any of the characters both new and old. Feels like a random movie released by Marvel just to keep the attention from the audience. Very disappointed.,1
Captain Marvel,It's like someone took bits of all the MCU scripts and stuck em together. Brie Larson is not athletic - bad casting.,1
Captain Marvel,"This movie was forgettable, had no memorable fight scenes, no memorable characters other then Nick fury and the cat and it kept shoving the feminist agenda in your face. I don't care that they were trying to push agenda but they weren't subtle about it and it just ended up annoying me. The movie was a strong woman's movie instead of a good movie with a strong woman (which would have been better). The movie keeps telling you that captain marvel cant control her emotions but Brie Larson (one of the worst actors in history) does a bland and boring performance and shows no emotion what so ever. The movie just felt rushed and lazy at some points. There was no interesting villain in the film so you'd never feel scared or worried for the characters. The character development was lazy and cliche to the point where it didn't even feel like development. Instead of showing that captain marvel is good character they just keep telling you so you'll never forget. What really disappointed me was how dull this movie is compared to other origin stories like black panther which for the record won a god damn award!Thanks to Brie Larson being in the cinematic universe now I'm very worried about Avengers Endgame and really hope she doesn't ruin it.",2
Captain Marvel,"This movie was by no means ""life-changing"" as people have said. It was honestly a lackluster film. The only saving grace were the special effects. The plot was all over the place. The acting was treacherous and it seemed like the director wanted to turn this into some feminist propaganda movie. I only went to see it because I want to be fully caught up when I go to see the highly anticipated Avengers: Endgame.",2
Captain Marvel,"I hate the way the end credits of Infinity War made me feel like i just HAD to see this movie. This was definitely a movie I could have done without seeing and a waste of money. The story was boring, the acting was stiff and corny. It was like watching a superhero parody movie. Almost a comedy, I laughed and cringed through the whole movie. I am a female writing this review and I did not like this movie AT ALL. The part where she said ""I've been fighting with one hand tied behind my back"" which was supposed to be a pivotal moment for the movie was the most laughable moment on screen. Also, there was no character development and very many plot holes. The way Nick Fury lost his eye was absolutely ridiculous a cat scratch...REALLY? This move is a disgrace to the MCU.",1
Captain Marvel,"Do you enjoy watching a movie in which the main character has the same facial expression throughout the entire movie? If yes, then this movie is made for you otherwise stay away from this horrific movie. The excuse is ""they rushed this for Endgame"", but still couldn't have a worse job.
There isn't a single enemy or moment in the movie where you feel that the hero is in any danger. The origins of her powers still make absolutely no sense and this movie answers no questions and just tells you that this happened and accept it without any background. I've honestly never been so bored at a cinema in my entire life. I'd give it 3 stars but the acting drags it down to 1.",1
Captain Marvel,I just can't understand why the critics gave this film anything! Jude Law and his gang are the only good thing about it and you'd think they would find a star who could run. Brie Larson looks like she had to go to athletic school for a crash course but didn't make it past the first jog!,1
Captain Marvel,"This is by far one of the weakest and most boring MCU movies since the black panther. And what bothers me is movies such as this and black panther are only praised not because of actual talent from production/actors but because they uphold ""social justice"". Not only was this an SJW ridden crapfest its also very boring the lead female actress is TERRIBLE, monotone and immature. Jude Law would have been FAR superior as the main character. Waste of time and money.",1
Captain Marvel,"I've liked Brie Larson in other films, but she showed ZERO range in this. When your main character in a superhero movie is unwatchable, you already have a problem. In addition, Captain Marvel has no weaknesses, which kills the tension immediately. There is no point at which you feel she is in any danger of losing, or any danger at all for that matter.It's an OK origin story, but it makes no sense as to WHY she's supposedly so powerful.The cat was good.",2
Captain Marvel,There is nothing to look forward to in this movie. The story is so bad that Dark World would seem watchable.,1
The Least Of These,"You wont find any surprises in the plot. It's a story that's been done many times over, some successfully, most not so much. But, what makes this one stand out as successful is the excellent acting by the recognizable older faces, as well as the young actors. Shot, scored, and directed very simply, the locations and music add perfect compliment to the casually paced yet not slow story progression. Job well done by the director, composer and cinematographer, for not letting their own visions overshadow a movie that rightfully is about the characters. This is by no means a happy movie, but despite the heavy storyline, you will find yourself with a smile as the credits begin to roll, a smile that feels organic, not forced. Fine movie making.",4
The Least Of These,"The least of these is a drama-thriller about mysteries, secrets and religion. Without telling too much, this has a story which is like so many others. Still this story as more layers than you'd expect.A colored priest comes as a teacher to a Catholic boys' school. In fact the same school he attended as a youngster. As he arrives, he gets told that ""The first thing a priest learns is how to keep a secret"". However, there's more secrets here, and the new priest has some secrets of his own.This film attacks the secrecy of which we've heard much about around the catholic church for the latter years. This film treats it good, but perhaps not as good as we've seen others have done it. Still it hits the mark well enough to grip you, and to keep your attention.The film is also packed with good acting from great actors. Maybe from time to time instructed a tiny bit naive, which also adds to the film's lesser credits. Director Nathan Scoggins, also the writer of this script, here made his second feature, after previously being more known as a writer. He uses a slow approach to the storytelling as well as the solving of the mystery. However both Isaiah Washington, as the colored priest, Robert Loggia, Bob Gunton and John Billingsley as the other priests are doing great in their roles. So are many of the teenage boys. The film was made on a low budget, but production values are good. The marketing budget of course was also too small for this film to get a wide enough distribution, so this film would be considered as a gem by many of those linking this kind of stories. It good enough to be deserved to be watched by a larger audience.This film thematically resembles films like there, of which not all of them are base on Catholicism or religion, but more also about child abuse. Sleepers, Priest, The Magdalena Sisters, Deliver us from evil, King of Devil's Island, Twist of faith, Troubled waters, Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the house of God, The Boys from St. Vincents, Hands of God, Calvary, Sex crimes of the Vatican and the forthcoming The spotlight team.",4
The Least Of These,"***MAJOR SPOILERS*** The film in covering the explosive subject of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church takes the middle ground in showing that as shocking as it is there's also a lot of exploitation on the part of some of the so-called victims and their family members to use the false charges of sexual abuse among the priests and nuns in the church for strictly monetary reasons. It's Father Andre James, Isaiah Washington, who should know better then most in what a false accusation of sexual abuse against a priest can do. He in fact was guilty of that charge back at St.Matthews where unknowingly he had his best friend Father Mark Roberts, Lance Guest,thrown out of the priesthood by backing up a false accusation of sexual abuse against him. That was concocted by a student and his family that, in losing a major law civil suite, ended up bankrupting St.Matthews.Depressed guilt ridden and almost suicidal in what he did to his friend Mark Roberts, who's now unemployed and an alcoholic, Father Andre James is given a second chance to make up for his mistake by Father William Jennings, Robert Loggia, at his Allentide Catholic Boys Boarding School. It's in fact at Allentide where years ago a 12 years old student Andre James was himself sexually abused by a priest Father Whitman. That incident was not only covered up by the school but it left Andre emotionally scared for life.As a teacher in the school Father James senses that student Parker Remy, Gordon Garrett, seems to be suffering from the results of being sexually abused by his very unstable and paranoid actions as well as being on anti psychotic medication. As Father James digs farther into Parker's background he finds out that he was very close to a Father Collins who had since disappeared into thin air after he was transferred form the school. Checking on what the relationship was between Parker & Father Collins Father James is shocked to find out that Father Collins was in fact involved in a number of sexual abuse incidents with students in Catholic schools that he once taught in! As Father James starts to uncover facts about the missing Father Collins his superiors in the school begin to uncover what he himself was involved in back at St. Matthews where he ended up disappearing into thin air, like Father Collins did, for two years. ***SPOILERS***Still not deterred by the accusations thrown against him Father James with his job in Allentide hanging on a thread tracks down the reason that Father Collins disappeared and it was not of his own choosing. It was murder! And the person who murdered Father Collins was in fact one of the many students that he abused in the school! And what's even worse it was the schools headmaster Father William Jennings, who gave Father James his job there, who covered up the murder and ended up hiding the body by dumping it, wrapped in a body bag, into a nearby lake to keep the truth about Father Collins actions from seeing the light of day! As well as setting the stage for a major law suite against Allentide that would end up bankrupting the school!Even handed in its theme, sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, the movie does in fact cop out a bit by sugar coating the fact that it's only a few and in this case only one individual, Father Jennings, who's involved in covering the abuse up. It's hard for me to believe that Father Jennings could have done all this in not only covering up Father Collins actions but even deep sixing his body all by himself without the knowledge and even help of his fellow priests in the school. The big plus in the film is Isaiah Washington depiction of the guilt ridden Father Andre James who despite what he did in the past as well as the sexual abuse he suffered, at the hands of Father Whitman, was still able to put that all aside and not let it interfere in his investigation what happened to Father Collins. And getting to the bottom of not only who ended up murdering father Collins but what he himself did to put it, his being murdered, into motion.",4
The Least Of These,"At a small Catholic High School in Connecticut, everyone knows everyone elses business. One priest has mysteriously disappeared, while another has come to take his place. That priest is former student, Andre James (Isaiah Washington), who from the very beginning knows he isn't entirely welcome at his old school, which he comes to find holds many old secrets. I'm always a bit weary of films that are centered on religion, because if isn't done just right the film is ruined. If there isn't enough of a religious angle, the film isn't believable, but if there's too much, it feels like you're being converted. The Least of These manages to strike a perfect balance, as religion is a part of the story, but it doesn't dominate every aspect of the film. The true heart of this film is in it's mysteries, such as what happened to the old priest and what's this new guy all about? Isaiah Washington stars in what turns out to be the first serious role I've seen him play, and he is outstanding. Father James is battling his own demons and for all the good he wants to do, a part of him doesn't feel entirely comfortable in his new surroundings. Quite ingeniously, Washington is able to portray this not through words, but through his demeanor, which changes as the story progresses. Washington is paired with Jordan Garrett who is always very likable no matter what type of character he is playing. It doesn't matter if he's playing an evil kid on Law & Order or the innocent victim in Death Sentence, Garrett somehow always manages to connect with the audience and get them pulling for his character. In this film, he plays an introverted outcast, who seems to be devastated by the disappearance of Father Collins. After connecting with Father James, the boy opens up and becomes yet another mystery of the old school. The Least of These was pretty entertaining and I suspect that a lot of the bad user reviews come from people who didn't make it through the whole film. I agree that it starts out slow and takes forever to get moving, but once it does, it really is a terrific story told by a stellar cast.",3
The Least Of These,"I had no idea what I was in store for when Virgil (my partner) brought home this DVD... Virgil had fallen asleep so I settled down with a bag of Lay's chips and a glass of Dr. Pepper to watch ""The Least of These"" starring Isaiah Washington...needless to say I am writing this review as I was riveted to this story and fell uncontrollably into simple yet acute adoration for all, even Jason, in this cast. I have two sons of my own, and a grandson so I am a bit biased...but please know this story really touched me in a way I have not felt in a long, long time...Thank you to the producers and the cast as well as all the souls who brought this project to completion - God bless and keep each one of you and your families and friends.Seattle's Coletha ;-}",5
Kavaludaari,"Script, Screenplays and plot development is brilliant. Actors have done a great job connecting with human emotions. Great tribute to the men in Uniform.",5
Kavaludaari,"This film's trailer and songs had set great expectations from the director Hemanth Rao especially after his exceptional directorial debut ""Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu"" back in 2016. However the expectations don't seem to have lived up to that extent in this movie. The story begins when Shyam (Rishi of Operation Alamelamma fame), a traffic policeman who is bored of his work and wants to move to the crime branch, gets fascinated when the skeletal remains of a family related to an old murder case are found at a metro construction site. He secretly follows up the case and begins his hunt for the murderer and the links related to it. This leads him to retired police inspector Mutthanna (Anant Nag) who was originally in-charge of the case and who now lives a life of solitude, drinking all day long. Once Shyam gains Mutthanna's trust, they both team up and continue the hunt. There are many other characters who appear in between and the movie throws up some intriguing twists and turns. The pace of the movie is slow right from the beginning until the end and the film gets gripping only in the last 30 minutes. Also the length of the movie must have been shorter. Except for these two things, the film has its own bewildering & intriguing moments and is otherwise a good watch and won't disappoint you. The acting is also realistic with the star cast having performed brilliantly especially Rishi, Anant Nag and Achyuth Kumar who are the standout performers. Paired with this is the excellent cinematography by Advaitha Gurumurthy and some mind boggling mysterious music (mainly the song Nigooda) by Charan Raj. Overall you can watch this movie if you have the patience to sit through a slow paced thriller or if you are a psychological crime thriller movie enthusiast.",4
Kavaludaari,"One of the main drawbacks of Kavaludaari is it is slow paced , yes. But it requires the time to explain the story. Brilliant performances by Rishi and Ananth Nag. Rishi has done exceptionally well for his second film. Shout out to Hemanth Rao who is a gem of Kannada Cinema in the new wave of directors. Some plot twists in the movie could have been done without , just seemed too much. Overall it's a brilliant film with breathtaking music and sound mixing. Don't miss it.",5
Kavaludaari,"The performances of all the actors were mind boggling. The story, at the beginning puts you at the edge of your seat and as time goes on, it becomes boring. They definitely could have reduced the lag, which was sort of unwanted. The climax was brilliant, but at by that time, people would lose their patience and not follow it properly. Therefore, I'm going to give a 7 star.",4
Kavaludaari,Wow pure masterpiece go ahed kannada cinema first kgf 2nd this movie plz go watch it,5
Kavaludaari,"Kavaludaari tells the story of traffic inspector, K.S. Shyam(Rishi). Shyam finds some evidence connected to an old unresolved case. He takes the help of retired inspector Muthanna(Anant Nag), to crack the mystery surrounding this case.Kavaludaari is a mind-blowing movie. Writer-director Hemanth M. Rao has knocked it out of the park yet again, after Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu(2016). This film is a classic whodunit & keeps you guessing, right till the end. The background score by Charan Raj is sensational. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Rishi is spectacular as K.S. Shyam. From his happy-go-lucky character in Operation Alamelamma(2017), to the conflicted character he's playing in Kavaludaari, Rishi's acting prowess knows no bounds. Anant Nag is outstanding as usual, as Muthanna. Achyuth Kumar is amazing as Kumar. Roshni Prakash & Suman Ranganathan are good, in their respective performances. Samanvita Shetty is sensational as Mrs. Naidu. Sidhartha Maadhyamika is awesome as Mr. Naidu. The supporting cast is brilliant. Kavaludaari is a must watch. Go check it out even if you don't understand Kannada, as there are English subtitles. Sandalwood's best thriller. Watch it as soon as possible, guys!",5
Five Feet Apart ,"I'm a 35 year old with CF. I was excited about this movie because any representation is potentially great. But I've seen other CF movies, seen it on TV, and it's usually terribly done. Incorrect nonsense, people are on o2 but climbing hills like it's no big deal, the severity isn't properly shown, etc.This movie manages to mostly stay away from that. Is it 100% accurate? Of course not. It's still a Hollywood film. It's not a documentary. That being said, this does a better job than any other CF fiction I've ever seen. It includes a lot of the real things that CFers deal with: all our therapies, nebs, vesting, the ports, the G tubes, the o2, surgeries, the isolation, the survivor's guilt, and many others.A lot of people in the CF community have been up in arms about two CFers getting together despite the bacteria concerns. While I understand the hesitation, I personally know four couples where both spouses had/have CF (had because some have died). We need to look at this as a real situation because it is. There's a lot of isolation in CF, and reaching out to the only people on the planet who can truly understand you is only natural. As long as both people are consenting adults, know the risks, and go for it anyway, we need to respect that.I appreciate that this movie tackles both the reality of CF and the controversial subject of CFers breaking the six foot rule. This is a very real film, and not once did I feel offended or roll my eyes. Not 100% accurate, no, but I feel seen. I feel represented. Absolutely worth seeing, and i look forward to seeing it again.",4
Five Feet Apart ,"I just saw the movie in theatres and cried !! I swear literally everyone in the theatres was crying. This is the saddest movie i have ever seen !! It's great movie talking about cystic fibrosis and people with a deadly disease and how they can live between hope and falling apart. This movie is fantastic and amazing from the beginning to end. For all of you, go see it you wont regret it. This is for first time i gave full mark 10 score only for this movie !! I hope this movie can winning an oscar awards !!",5
Five Feet Apart ,"Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) is a teenager that spends most of her time in the hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines and she has got everything figured out until she meets Will (Cole Sprouse), another teen with the same terminal and chronic illness. Flirtation quickly turns into broken rules with potentially deadly consequences.Our Take: If you're in the mood for a good cry in a dark theater, it's a good watch; but it will be just as good when it is on Netflix and can be watched in the comfort of your home with your favorite stuffed animal and a box of Kleenex.
Post-Credit Scene: Nope, you can run to the bathroom as soon as they start rolling.Let us guess: you loved The Fault in Our Stars. So are you in the mood for another sick kids movie? Well, this checks all the boxes. There are kids. The kids are sick. Plus, it tugs on all the appropriate heartstrings. But if you look beyond the trope, what is there?Here, there's actually a lot to unpack.This was the directorial debut for Justin Baldoni (of Jane the Virgin fame) and he did a decent job putting the movie together. The cast was the right mix of a popular teenage heartthrob, a kid you remember from some show you used to watch, and a talented girl next door. There's an appropriate amount of chemistry between Richardson and Sprouse. The soundtrack assembled every indie rock song that mentioned medicine or illness, but it was employed in a very tasteful manner. There were a few moments of questionable shakey cam footage that made watching difficult. There was a scene that was purposefully dragged out for the purpose of making the audience uncomfortable in a completely unnecessary way. The dialogue was a bit weak at times, but for characters that you knew had an impending expiration date, they were all fairly well developed. It wasn't perfect, but in the grand scheme of sick kid movies, it certainly ranks and in some ways, set itself apart.Unlike similar films of the past (A Walk to Remember, The Fault in Our Stars, and Everything Everything to name a few) this one wasn't based on a book (plot twist: there's a book based on it). It is also set primarily at the hospital and over a fairly short period of time, which tightened the narrative in a strange and at times off-putting way that other films have managed to escape. The film stayed fairly true to treatment mechanisms that are available to those with cystic fibrosis thanks to its consultant, the late Claire Wineland, though it fell into the same controversy its predecessors have by casting able-bodied individuals to play diseased and disabled characters. Some have called the film disease-appropriation, but as two people who don't have cystic fibrosis, this film did bring our attention to a disease we'd never heard of. It's not our place to say whether this newfound awareness is good, but we do hope that it has a positive impact by showing a snippet of what some people with CF deal with.",4
Five Feet Apart ,"I feel compelled to write this review for all of those guys who get dragged along to see some cheezy romance flick by the wife or girlfriend and can barely make it through without trying to duck into the adjacent theater for something action oriented.That's how I ended up watching this, but honest-to-God . . . I have to give credit where credit is due. I'm usually so cynical about movies that seem so clearly intent on going straight for the heartstrings and forcing every girl in the audience to go for the emergency kleenex stash in the purse. I hate that feeling of being manipulated. ""Five Feet Apart"" actually works very well on all of the important levels. Cystic fibrosis is not a common disease, and I certainly wasn't familiar with it. But the script and the actors handle the condition with surprising sensitivity. Rather than making it the focus of an emotional trainwreck, no one seems to be working overtime to make you feel sorry for them. Rather, we get to see what seems to be a surprisingly appealing group of teenagers who've accepted the condition in various ways long before the opening scenes of the movie, and they are going to move forward with life without asking for our sympathy.There is a serious level of chemistry between Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse that has to be one of the most believable pairings I recall in this genre.
The growing sparks between them effectively places this truly debilitating genetic condition in just the right context. They don't want your sympathy--they just want a slim chance at happiness. Yes, the teenage girls in the audience were crying rivers at the end . . . but for once . . . I could completely understand it.",4
Five Feet Apart ,"Teenage romance movies always hold special places in a lot of people's hearts, but depending on the decade your familiar with, the elements and presentation are a little different. Eighties brought comedy with emotional drama, nineties was the Nicholas Sparks beginning with the cute, cheesy tactics, early 2000s were all about the Nicholas Sparks, super dramatic stories that hold a lot of places in the hearts of the public. Then came the 2010s and the twist was now romance, but put some type of terminal illness with it to sweeten the deal... So tonight's movie continues this current trend, taking another story in hopes of invoking tears and pulling the heart strings of the audience at the same time. Yes, tonight is Five Feet Apart and yours truly is here to write his reviews as always and share his opinions. Let's go:Movie: Five Feet Apart (2019)Director:

Nice SurprisesSUMMARY: The latest movie fills the formula of sad, drama meeting the romantic teenage plotlines. Fortunately, the acting is there to bring a fantastic dynamic to latch onto in the form of Cole Sprouse and Harley Lu Richardson. Their chemistry is amazing, bringing the two sides of the romantic cone to life in a very sweet, charming, and surprisingly realistic way. Five Feet Apart takes these characters and does a fantastic job advancing them past the carbon copy templates most of these films do. The supporting cast does a wonderful job of being integrated into the story, their own tales and dynamics meshing well to bring out the main characters in new ways.
Of course the movie somehow manages to add on to the simple romantic story by appreciating other dynamics that can be included in romance movies. The comedy is simple and classy, fitting very well with the tone of the movie without being too forced. For those enjoying symbology in the visual arts, the rooms and works of our proverbial Romeo and Juliet have plenty of artistic bite that is quite impressive to behold, instigating a little jealously in my mind about their artwork.
As for the romance component itself, again I give them props for finding a way to bring love and beauty into a realistic way that was both poetic and fun to behold. Five Feet Apart takes most of the cheese factor out of the romance, and instead makes it an adventure that is fun to go on. The ordeal of the disease contending with the blossoming love is a driving force of the film and somehow manages to be fresh despite how plotted love tales are. Perhaps it is also the surprises that come in at points that assists with keeping the adventure going, finding ways to divert from the film, without going too far away from the tale at hand. With all these components it works very well for me.
DISLIKES:Predictable
Cheesy At Times
Scientific Stretches
The Parent Components?
SUMMARY: No surprise, the movie follows much of the same formula, and my friend and I were able to predict much of the movie based on the trailers we had seen. Fortunately, surprises were able to help with this, but they still held some trouble keeping the romantic movie cheese fest from happening. Five Feet Apart leaves much of the mushy, gushy, Nicholas Sparks like drama that is difficult to get away from, which is a selling point for most going to these movies, but for me could have used a little more spice up.
In addition, some of the scientific plausibility for one with my mindset are difficult to get over in terms of the miracles vs. the statistical chances of the real life. Some of the interactions, primarily in the ending occurring the way it did, was very unrealistic and seeing these miracle moments only added to the cheesy coincidences that this series is famous for. If that's not something that bothers you, no worries on this, but for me this is just something to warrant on. As for the parents, they were okay, but I felt that for something as intense as the themes in this movie, some more involvement would be seen. Five Feet Apart's weakest characters are actually the parents, reduced to a few lines of dialogue and the background images. Sure, it's not about them, but in the other films similar to this, the parents were very active in the support of the kids. What happened here?
The VERDICT:Overall, Five Feet Apart was much better than I had anticipated, with a lot more heart, artistic beauty, and adventure than many of the romance/dramas that I've seen. A strong cast, character usage, and surprises in terms of comedy and plot were the selling points for this reviewer in regards to this film. It still has predictability and cheese factors, primarily in the scientific stretches, but the good far outweighs the bad for me in regards to this category of movies. I think this is one for the theater in regards to dramas. If not check this one out for a rent/stream because it's got the heart that movies are known to have.My scores are:Drama/Romance: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0",4
Five Feet Apart ,Not necessarily from the movie. There was a girl with Cystic Fibrosis in the crowd that completely lost it. The story hit way too home for her. Considering that I dont see how I couldn't give this a rave review.,5
Five Feet Apart ,Does what it says on the tin and some more. Solid acting and I learned a lot more about CF which hopefully we all do. Probably the only person in the theatre that didn't cry though!,5
Five Feet Apart ,"Wifes choice tonight and she picked this movie. It was great! We laughed, cried, and smiled all throughout the film. I'm always hesitant to watch these types of movies because of it feeling cheesy or forced but it didn't at all! Really enjoyed it.",5
Five Feet Apart ,"Greetings again from the darkness. The all-too-familiar sick/dying teenager genre is frequently associated with Lifetime Channel movies or something of that ilk. What sets this one apart (and above) many in the slew of similarly themed movies is the script, and more so, two outstanding lead performances. Director Justin Baldoni is best known as an actor and director of TV projects, but he (mostly) handles the script from Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis quite well.Rising star Haley Lu Richardson (COLUMBUS, SPLIT) plays Stella, a teenager who has been dealing with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) her entire life. When we first meet her, she has checked back in to the hospital for a ""tune-up"". Despite her breathing struggles and medical issues, Stella is a shining light of optimism who is friendly with the entire hospital staff and other patients. She's also OCD and maintains a strict regimen on her meds in hopes of hanging on long enough for the holy grail - a lung transplant, or ultimately a miracle cure for this death sentence disease. Stella maintains two to-do lists: one for the day, and another for her bucket list. She also runs a YouTube channel where she educates us on what it's like living with CF.On one of her frequent visits to the hospital nursery to watch the newborn babies, Stella crosses paths with Will (Cole Sprouse), a more cynical CF patient who has B cepacia form - so deadly that sufferers aren't included on the lung transplant list. In contrast to Stella, Will wonders if the hassle of treatment is worth the pain and inconvenience, when so little hope is present. CF patients are required to don gloves, masks, and oxygen packs. One rule that must not be broken is to maintain at least a 6 foot distance at all times between themselves and any other CF patient. The risk of passing along their specific mixture of bacteria is simply too great.'Opposites attract' is in play here as Stella and Will share only one trait, and it's a bond where being too close could literally kill one or both of them. These are smart and interesting characters who understand there are no ""happily ever afters"" in their future. We are along for the ride as they learn more about each other. Will is a talented sketch artist with a wicked sense of humor in his cartoons, while Stella carries a special burden of putting others at ease while focusing on the present and looking to the future, thanks to the exploits of her beloved older sister Abby (Sophia Bernard).Other supporting actors include Claire Forlani as Will's mother, Parminder Nagra (BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM) as the doctor, Kimberly Hebert Gregory as the strict and caring Nurse Barb, and Moises Arias as Poe, a witty gay teenager and fellow CF patient, who has been friends with Stella since they were young kids. As the romance blooms for Stella and Will, there are some too-familiar moments and a couple of lame musical interludes with slow-motion ... but there are also some terrific and heartfelt scenes. In particular, a pool cue at the pool is extraordinarily tender and romantic.The film teases us a few times with assumptions, but the theme of human touch is ever-present. For CF patients, is love selfish or is it an inherent need? 'The lights are like stars' is a nice touch that explains how this disease forces these folks to think a little differently and find joy in the moment ... yet still keep their distance. Sure, Ms. Richardson (a bona fide star in the making) and Mr. Sprouse are a bit too old to be playing teenagers, but their talent allows us to take in the layers here with the disease and the limitations on life. The film has plenty of laughs and plenty of tears (bring your tissue) as we watch a heartfelt romance while also learning some of the challenges facing the 30,000 CF patients in the U.S.",4
Five Feet Apart ,"My husband and I saw this last night, we are in our 30's, and both cried like babies all throughout the movie. I didn't even cry this much in the Notebook or PS I Love You or Me before you (and any other sad movie you can think of). I wanted to write a review because I hear a lot of comparisons to The Fault In Our Stars; yes both have sickly teenagers who fall in love but the stories are still completely different. Haley Lu Richardson's acting is amazing and blows it out of the park compared to Shailene Woodley...though not nice to compare as both are great stories in their own unique ways. Her portrayal of Stella was so natural and believable though. The rest of the actors were great too. Take tissues, eat candy, enjoy life and hug your loved ones. Go see this movie!",5
Five Feet Apart ,"I thought it would be corny like the fault in our stars, but it was so well done. It was a beautiful movie.",5
Five Feet Apart ,"The movie as it stands alone is cute. Both leads portray their characters well, and the movie can be related to The Fault in Our Stars in many respects. However, the movie was terribly rushed but was drawn out. The first hour of the movie had very little character development and instead of developing the characters and letting you make opinions on them, it stated facts and rushed into the characters. For example, when Poe died in the movie, I felt very little because he had not been developed at all.
My other complaint is how picky they are with what they can and cannot do. There were times throughout the movie where you said to yourself ""this is not a safe thing for someone with CF to do"" but they do it anyway. For example, they dedicated a scene of where Stella vigorously washed her hands and clothes after going in and touching things in Will's room, or when Will wouldn't blow out his candle for fear of contaminating the dessert, but five minutes earlier, Poe is seen cooking with his face in the food that everyone is going to eat. Just didn't make much sense.",3
Five Feet Apart ,"If you have watched the trailer you know how the story would unfold. Sick teens, fights at first, falls in love, does things to comfort each other, one lead saves the other with some tears and a hopeful ending. There would be no over the top moments or mind bending twists. This movie follows a template like I mentioned but its not boring. Haley lu is expressive and you feel for her. She has a complex to be organized and wants to live and expects other to follow the same. Cole sprouse is rigid at first but towards the climax, he has a powerful scene to redeem himself. Climax I feel was a bit stretched , could have been crisp if it was short. A decent directorial debut from justin baldoni. All in all a decent movie. Delivers what it promises.. Nothing more nothing less..!",4
Five Feet Apart ,"Stella is a bright, breezy 17-year old, in hospital for a regular ""tune up"", necessary as a cystic fibrosis patient. Fortunately, she is a keen blogger, and her blogs give us the main information we need to appreciate what follows - the prognosis that most sufferers die by the age of 30, and that sufferers should never get within 6 feet of each other for fear of infection. So when Stella encounters fellow CF patient (and wilful free spirit) Will, it is only a matter of time before they fall for each other. And they can't even kiss.""Disease of the week"" movies are far from unknown and, more often than not, they are cross-pollinated with teen romance, as is the case here. Having said that, this is not bad of its kind. Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse are attractive - perhaps too attractive - as the leads. Moises Arias pleases as Poe, another CF patient, and is a world apart from the character he played in Ender's Game.The plot meanders away from the expected every now and then, although this is not an illness where happy endings are commonplace. The film is often emotional without too much blatant manipulation. The thing which saddened me most was the fact that these two young people in love are never able to kiss. Heartbreaking.",4
Five Feet Apart ,"Just came back from the cinema in London to watch this movie..I'm actually not one of those people who writes a review as I've never found a movie that inspired me this much in my life. A movie full of emotions and such reality, something that I also never find in these kind of movies is that, their disease somehow always disappears at the end, so that the protagonists can have a happily ever after. I love the fact that this movie it's not the common clich, which I also why I want to became an actress so bad in the future, as I would love for people to watch my movies, and to get the message and the emotions I'm trying to spread in them. Anyways, a recap of everything? TOTALLY recommend it! The best movie I've watched so far! I wish there could be a sequel because I'm really curious on how the story would keep going..would they ever meet again? Will Stella be able to survive with the new lungs for more than 5 years? I cried so much because, even though I don't have the disease, I still felt the character's pain, which is something that happens really rarely for me while I watch a movie..as I mentioned above..the BEST movie I've watched so far! Go and watch it!",5
Five Feet Apart ,"This may not be a reboot, a squeal, a twisted thriller, a Comic Con front runner, or even your typical romcom. Definitely not your typical romcom.What it is is an important movie that reminds the viewers that there is a whole other world going on around us. I world that reminds us not to take for granted the simple, lovely joys of kissing someone hello, or hugging them goodbye, even taking a deep breath.I loved this movie and the actors make you feel very comfortable in their world.",5
Five Feet Apart ,"Every once in a while, you go to the movies to watch a movie simply because you miss the whole ""let's go get pop corn, sit back, and catch a flick"" type of experience. (for me that's every week)And you watch something random.You have fear that what you are about to watch might even ruin your evening, by being nothing more than Hollywood amateur hour.Then, you are pleasently surprised. The acting is good. The chemistry between the protagonists is irresistible.
The plot is raw. The movie makes you laugh. Cry. And have hope.This is what five feet apart does.Bravo.8.5/10",4
Five Feet Apart ,This is definitely a tear jerker and I would have given it a 10 except the ending is just not realistic. Great acting by all characters. I really enjoyed it.,5
Five Feet Apart ,"Saw this movie with my wife, best friend, and his wife. My best friend happens to have CF and have been familiar with disease. Some people will say it's too similar to A Fault in Our Stars but it really isn't. After watching some interviews about the 2 stars it's crazy to see their chemistry they have without any casting reads together.",5
Five Feet Apart ,"I asked the old dear who checks the tickets if it was any good and she told me a lot of people who'd seen it had cried. Id already seen The Aftermath which shows Keira Knightly whimper for 90 mins so wasn't expecting great things.Sad, depressing, frustrating yet interesting and engaging insight into the lives of several teens who are battling illness. Just make sure the tissues are close by",4
Five Feet Apart ,"The script to this film is quite bad. It leans into cliches. It makes some pretty melodramatic and repugnant choices in its third act. It repeats the basic medical issues of cystic fibrosis a lot. The exposition isn't even handle in a clever way. (The main character has a YouTube series about cystic fibrosis). The plotting is thoroughly predictable and if you seen the trailer you know where the film is going. I will say the characterizations of Will, Poe, and Stella work. They each have a starkly different orientation towards cystic fibrosis; Will and Stella end up meeting in the middle of their opposite viewpoints. Yes that is a pretty common structure and boy can you feel the writers reaching for your heart strings. Lastly, I suspect cystic fibrosis is misrepresented in the film. I am really surprised this script got shot.The direction is a little better but it does nothing but embrace the soap opera tone of the script. In particular I found the cinematography too glossy to really capture the trials of chronic illness. The direction is traditional and risk adverse. Some of that is because of the script but I feel a more daring director would have done more with various conceits in the script. In particular, a few of the dates sequences could have been different than a montage and a pop song on the sound track. (I hated the soundtrack. It was very pop muzak for the most part).With all of those problems why on Earth am I giving this a positive review? Well it features three of the most well considered and charming performances I have seen in a teen melodrama. Arias as Poe is solid friend character; given Poe's fate Arias' likability and sweetness were very much needed. Sprouse is very tender when Will needs to be. He also captures the free spirited nature of Will with easy charm. He makes a good romantic foil. During the film's big erotic moments Sprouse just oozes sexiness and vulnerability.But above all Richardson owns this film. She makes Stella a person you care about and the character's quirks feel real. The script saddles her with some of the worst lines but she makes them work. She really leans into her character's physical limitations and the resulting material feels authentic. It is an absolutely winning performance. I don't know if that feature alone is enough to see the film, but it was enough for me to enjoy it on the level it was intended.",4
Five Feet Apart ,I absolutely adored this movie. I have been a fan of Cole Sprouse since Suite Life and he completely blew me away in this role! I read the book beforehand and I must say he portrayed Will so perfectly! I also loved Haley Lu Richardson as Stella. You couldn't help but smile while watching her portray a relatable teenage girl. The soundtrack was spot on. This story was inspiring. It teaches the importance of time and how the little things in life are truly what matters.,5
Five Feet Apart ,This is film is probably aimed at teenagers rather than their parents but it's not a bad film even watching as a parent.The subject is quite a novel one which does work and is well acted. It does give a bit of an insight into youngsters in that position and is rightly focused on them rather than those around them.But be warned this is not a feel good film it was a tough watch as the plot develops and it just seemed to find your emotions then stamp on them....Hard.,4
Five Feet Apart ,"I rarely cry during romance genre films as the love story always seems too perfect and not close to real life. However, I find myself crying during this film and I think the difference lie in the fact that this movie centers upon a real illness, making the movie feel much closer to real life and sympathetic. The difficulties faced by the characters and how they confided in one another and bonded over their struggles is an aspect that many can relate to in real life. The defiance the characters faced and wanting to enjoy their lives to the fullest is something everyone has felt at some point in their lives or still feels today. I think this movie makes me more content with my life and more appreciative of the people who have supported me through my ups and downs.",4
Five Feet Apart ,If you have read the book then you will be happy when you go see the movie. I knew from the beginning that the movie was going to be an emotional rollercoaster if they did the book justice and they did. I've never seen a movie where it portrayed the book accurately. The casting for this movie was spot on and everyone's performance was top notch. If you are a hopeless romantic then this is a movie for you. Be prepared to cry. Anyone that has negatively rated the movie doesn't understand how serious the effects of cystic fibrosis are and how true the story can be.,5
Jessie,"I've only read a handful of Stephen King novels, but 'Gerald's Game' just so happens to be one of them. I liked the novel without overly loving it. It had a memorable ending, but the story was a little bland for my liking. I've heard people say it's one of their favourite King novels and also heard people say it's one of their least favourite, so it's clearly quite a polarising novel. I was excited when I heard it was going to be made into a movie though. I almost always enjoy King movie adaptions and was very interesting to see how they went about the ending I spoke of earlier. It is very rare that I enjoy a movie more than the book version (almost to the point that I can't think of a single example before now), but this is almost certainly a case of that.When you think of a movie where the plot involves a woman tied to a bed for almost the entire run time, you would think they would scraping the barrel to reach 90 minutes. Instead they comfortable cruise to 103 minutes and it never really feels that stretched out.All the classic traits of King's work are featured. The well, the eclipse etc. Even the vibe just inexplicably feels like it's directly from his work. Director Mike Flanagan has once again done a fantastic job. He really is becoming a sure sign of a quality film.The whole cast was admittedly excellent, but it would have to be said that Carla Gugino carried the film. I wasn't too sure with her casting whether she was right for the role, but she proved me wrong to have any doubts. It would not have been an easy role, you're effectively being asked to carry the film on your shoulders, but she nailed it.I'm really glad this turned out so well. It's a smart, thought-provoking and moving story of survival that actually works better in film form than it did in book form. It's a great time to be a King fan right now, that's for sure.",4
Jessie,"Ten out of ten. Other viewers can complain all they want about this film being 'tedious' or 'bland', or slightly missing the mark or opportunity, but I strongly disagree. Makes me wonder if they got the true point of the novel, even. Stephen King is NOT a horror writer, so much as he is a writer of characters and extraordinary events that they go through, and most importantly, he writes about the deep emotional experiences that people endure in their lifetimes here on this earth. He tends to throw in dark elements, to be certain, and some of those are downright creepy, frightening, or straight-up horrific; this does not make him a horror writer. And anyone expecting a horror film here will subsequently be disappointed and, I guess, apparently bored. I was not bored, I was riveted the entire time. It's not easy to do what Mike Flanagan does with this adaptation. He nails the mental struggles and fractured psyche of the main character, Jessie, under the strain of what she faces. He also delivers on the heart of King's story, which isn't the present situation she finds herself in as an adult, but rather, dealing with secrets and ghosts from her past that have haunted her all her life, without her truly even knowing 'til her current situation arises. It's a beautiful novel of pain, suffering, secrets, abuse (on multiple levels, by multiple people), and the struggle to not just survive, but also heal and thrive, if possible. Flanagan's film captures the heart of King's story, and it is beautifully rendered, and many scenes are equally visually stunning. I cried at the end of the movie. Bruce Greenwood and Carla Gugino turn in excellent performances, among the best I've seen from both of them. Henry Thomas is equally and fittingly gross. Very well done. Even younger Jessie, played by Chiara Aurelia, was exacted with nuanced grace and heartbreak. This is just a terrific movie. And I find every scene featuring Carel Struycken to be extremely creepy, so I'm not certain how other reviewers find this movie lacking in creep value. I just can't disagree more. I love this movie, it's instantly and already in my top fifteen, maybe even my top ten favorite films of all time. Well done. I'll be watching this one more than once.",5
Jessie,"Saw this recently on a DVD. Having enjoyed Flanagans Occulus n Hush, (yet to c the sequel of Ouija) i was excited to see this. The film which is based on Kings novel is about a couple trying to save their marriage by spending time at a remote house. Thru trailer itself, v come to know that after handcuffing the wife on the bed, the husband suffers a heart attack leaving the wife tied up with no help near at all. 127 hours scenario? To make matters worse, there is a hungry dog on the prowl. The wife later starts hallucinating n she goes thru the mental trauma remembering her dark past.The film succeeded in capturing the creepiness of isolation and immobilization n the growing dread. The good thing about Flanagan is that he can manage to build up tension n suspense in spite of minimum characters n action. Hush was the best example. This movie is more of a psychological survival drama with elements of horror.",4
Jessie,"Stephen King is at times a brilliant writer, and most of his novels give a home-bred 70's vibe. There's the presence of raw indecency and rotten attachments right beside the gore, and this movie is very good at portraying that.I started watching this movie expecting to get bored at some point, because Gerald's Game is an odd pick of a novel to make into a film. A lot of the story revolves around the heroine spending hours alone and restricted. In a book, the writer has the freedom to play around with memories and weave them into the present, but was the director going to be able to do that?The answer is, yes, he is, and he does that very well. Kudos to a thoroughly entertaining experience, whether it was the 80's gore effects, the commendable acting of Mr. and Mrs. Gerald, or the shifts from almost comedic to certainly nauseating scenes. The only thing that bothered me was that the cinematography was a bit dated, and nothing creative. But it doesn't mean that this movie is not worth the watch, and it will be even more enjoyable if you haven't read the book!",4
Jessie,"Gerald's Game was surprisingly more introspective and less gruesome than I imagined (except one particularly cringe-worthy scene). From a viewer who didn't read the Stephen King novel the film was based upon, I went into the Netflix original prepared to be disturbed. The film doesn't waste time getting you to the meat of the story. From the start Carla Gugino gives an emotionally powerful performance as Jessie  a mentally abused victim struggling to repair a failing marriage - that sets the tone for the rest of the film. The reluctance she shows toward her husband Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) forces you to never sit comfortably as the plot begins to be painted. One of the great strengths of this movie was answering the questions you were going to ask before you asked them. Understanding from the beginning that Jessie was to end up handcuffed to a bed throughout the entirety of the film already had me questioning her inability to escape. As soon as you see her situation play out and begin to think of her options, the writers provided answers as to why that isn't possible in a unique and believable fashion. With the multitude of challenges she has to overcome she is forced to relive her disturbing past, which in-turn must help her overcome her shackled state if she is to even have a chance of surviving.The use of symbolism in this film is constant, but so much so that at times it seems to spell it out for you, or literally tell you. I felt the comparisons between her current situation and her past was a bit too blunt. I would've called for a little less hand-holding and a bit more mystery surrounding the connections that were made between the men in her life. Yet one of the most obvious symbols - the blood- red eclipse  was one that surprised me the most as its representation transforms into a powerful message of strength. The anchor for this film was Carla Gugino and her amazingly powerful performance with a great showing from co-star Bruce Greenwood. The dialogue and thought process that unfolded from the two kept me emotionally entwined in the story and eager to find out what would happen next. Along with fantastic performers, Gerald's Game was made better with the subtlety of the soundtrack and cinematography. I was more impressed at the times where there was no music playing at all, which seemed often and was appropriate. It built suspense and kept focus on the current scene when all the viewers were left with was the disturbing sounds of her struggle. The eclipse as mentioned was a favorite of mine. The deep red ring emphasized the horror of events unfolding, yet transformed with the character and began something greater. Even after the movie was finished I found myself thinking over the message that was left for the viewers to contemplate. It was one that I didn't expect and was glad to see at the same time. Gerald's Game was a fantastic physiological thriller that never had me shaking my head in un-believability. I enjoyed the restraint of music in key moments, and was enthralled by the situation presented. This makes two Stephen King adaptations that have nailed the difficult process of transforming a story from a book to film. JordanRoss gives Gerald's Game:8.1/10",4
Jessie,Masterpiece. The last ten minutes were brilliantly executed. This director's work is definitely on par with Frank Darabont's movies. Every sequences of the novel is present in the movie. Acting is delivered at its finest. Netflix need more Stephen King adaptations like this one. A must watch for everyone.-Dude from Blossomsoft,5
Jessie,"This is a step up from your usual horror NetFlix productions and especially from other Stephen King translations. I mean it was a bomb! And in the good way.So the movie itself has that 127 Hours touch, but far, far better than expected. And without spoiling it to you, I have to say Gerald's Game makes the most of everything. Not one detail is left untouched, the usage of the entire environment, memories makes for a terrific viewing experience. You'll be fed tension, scares, confusion, hope and denial, a beautiful game indeed that you just have to be part of. And let me say one more thing, the ending, that was just brilliant. The cherry on the cake. The cold beer after a long hard day. Simply put: RECOMMENDED!Cheers!",4
Jessie,"Having recently read ""Gerald's Game"" I still have a pretty good recollection of the book and found this screen adaptation to be very close to the original source. A couple minor points that don't jive would be Gerald's physical health; in the novel he's slightly overweight and not in very good shape, thereby making him a better candidate for a heart attack than a guy like Bruce Greenwood in the role. The other thing had to do with the location of the story. In the book, the house was more like a summer cabin secluded in the woods, whereas this looked like more of a neighborhood type setting. At least that's my recollection, probably more nit-picks than any problem with the screenplay.The movie here is every bit as tense and riveting as the written word, as most of the fear and horror involves a wife, Jessie Burlingame (Carla Gugino), left for helpless after she's been chained to a bed right before her husband (Greenwood) keels over from a massive heart attack. What was intended as a sexual role play turns into a battle for survival and control of one's imagination over all the potential bad things that could happen if someone doesn't come by to offer aid real soon. Director Mike Flanagan takes the approach of allowing the captive Jessie interact with Gerald, her father (Henry Thomas), and her younger self (Chiara Aurelia) in various imaginary scenarios which ultimately resurrect the trauma of an early child abuse episode.I have to admit, even though I've overcome a lot of squeamishness regarding physical injury over time, the scene of Jessie freeing herself from the bed had me squirming, to the point I had to get up and grab some apple juice to help the old blood sugar situation. That was just nasty. And lest I forget, that demonic looking German Shepherd looked like he could have gone berserk any minute. He looked more 'Cujo' than Cujo, if you know what I mean.And then, just as with the Stephen King novel, I thought the ending with the history of The Moonlight Man (Carel Struycken) came across as superfluous and unnecessary to the story. It does make sense in the grand scheme of things, especially with Jessie's nightmarish visions, because you didn't know at the time when she was trapped whether he was real or not. It's just that his revelation seems awkward, like it belonged to a different story altogether.But anyway, this is a very good adaptation of a Stephen King story, so if you're a fan, there's something here that won't make you dread an unfaithful treatment of the source material. I can't imagine Mr. King himself being displeased with the film at all.",4
Jessie,"I watched this movie because I was looking for recent, highly-rated horror movies on IMDb. I felt pretty misled by the rating which was 6.9 at the time of watching.The premise of the movie stoked my curiosity. I wondered how a woman being handcuffed to a bed could play out in a movie-length production since there didn't seem to be much to go on. Well, it's even more boring than you would expect.Don't get me wrong, the acting is not bad and the cinematography was a bit above-average as well. However, the story and dialogue dragged on horribly.At first, watching the interaction between the older couple feels incredibly awkward--and this is good because I think the film is intended to provoke this feeling. It's as if you are invited over to an older couple's house and they break out into an hour-long passive-aggressive fight in your presence. But it just doesn't stop. The characters make obviously stupid mistakes both in their relationship and in their kink-play. Since they make such stupid mistakes it is incredibly hard to relate to them or care about them.I kept waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen only to find that there was no pay-off. Avoid this movie if you are a horror fan looking for something scary or exciting. This movie is entirely a drama with some dark elements so maybe watch it if you are more geared towards that genre.",2
Jessie,One of the best Stephen king adaptations I've watched.Carla Gugino plays a really remarkable performance. I am so impressed while watching the film. The movie is as attractive as the book. I hope Netflix will make more Stephen King adaptations. I loved it very much. And the form of handling child abuse was also very sensitive and subtle.,4
Jessie,"I checked three times to see if this was a Lifetime movie. If you like that sort of thing, you will probably like this movie. If you think this will be a normal horror/thriller movie, like it is listed, you will be disappointed. Yes, there is a Stephen-King-esque twist in the last 3 or 4 minutes that might, possibly, be creepy enough to qualify as horror, but 98% of this movie is about a woman coming to terms with her childhood sexual abuse. You have been warned.",3
Jessie,"The beginning is rather promising as we are introduced to a sex deprived couple in need of rekindling their marriage. The problem here is the first 20 minutes already tell the story, leaving you to sit through boring memories/drama of the handcuffed woman's life.People are saying the Stephen King book on this was great and i can not doubt it as i have not read it, but what i see is people being incredibly biased to Stephen King novel movie adaptations, the fans still give great ratings to this film, even though it is absolute crap, i hate to see that. The movie feels boring for most of the screen time as you simply can not get excited about what is going to happen next, because we kind of know that nothing is about to happen, because of the setting. But if the movie itself felt boring and stupid to you, wait till the ending, i am absolutely shocked about the way this film ended. This has got to be one of the stupidest and worst ideas in the history of film making, the ending is absolutely horrible beyond belief.Definitely something we all will forget, absolutely nothing clever, funny or extra ordinary about this film. They tried making the woman absolutely delusional to pass the time obviously, if she was just sitting there the whole time it would not even last 20 minutes, would it? But that was also a massive flop, since the delusions were simply not engaging enough for you to care about the plot or the outcome of this film. Completed with a laughably dire ending this movie is a joke and definitely not worth your time!",1
Jessie,"GERALD'S GAME stands out as the worst Stephen King novel I've ever encountered, a near-plot less journey through various concepts all based around a single-location thriller, which I typically love. I found it dragged out endlessly and entirely dull, and guess what? This unappetising film follows suit.As in the novel, the premise is a workable one. The attractive Carla Gugino is handcuff to a bed in a remote cabin and must figure out a way to escape. However, as with the book, the whole film is chock full of irrelevant sub-plots, unpleasant flashbacks about child abuse, and a ridiculous 'bogeyman' storyline that destroys all credibility. The actual present-day/non-hallucination material is very limited.What's worst about this is the endless inane back-and-forth dialogue with the imaginary characters, which truly takes the biscuit. There are flashes of strong material, including a very nasty gore scene, but they come few and far between.",1
Jessie,"After watching the trailer I thought ""well, now I've seen the whole movie without even having to watch it"", but HELL NO!! This is definitely a psychological thriller that invokes fear, panic, and a touch of nausea just for what this poor woman is going through. The story is so much bigger than you imagine.?It's not necessarily gory but there are a few seconds that are look away scenes...The acting was superb and the storyline is new and fresh...I was a huge Stephen King fan growing up but fell off the Castle Rock wagon a while ago and didn't even know he was behind this madness until I read the reviews after watching this movie. Maybe it's because I usually like his books better and didn't know this was his going in since I never read it. Definitely two thumbs up",4
Jessie,"Netflix pretty much had all the right elements in place - beautiful setting, gorgeous cinematography, strong acting from the man who played Gerald, but weak acting from his wife. Unfortunately, the entirety of the film rests on her shoulders, and that's where the flick failed.I'm sure she's a a fine actress, but she didn't portray her angst, her anger, her complete disgust about being chained to a bed while a stray dog ate her husband. She was just non-believable, like she could care less what happened to her. Unfortunately, this translates into the audience not caring a toss what happens to her, either. At one point I didn't care if the stray mutt leaped onto the bed and tore her apart at the jugular veins. They should've tried to get more energy or feeling from the actress. They failed, and this lethargic film failed because of it.",3
Jessie,"There are very few works of art (film, music, literature, etc.) that truly scare me or leave me feeling unsettled. Reading Stephen King's novel ""Gerald's Game"" was one of those rare experiences. This adaptation, directed by Mike Flanagan, expertly captures the essence of that creepy novel and puts it on the small screen. Earlier this fall, I proclaimed ""It"" to be perhaps the best book-to-film adaptation I have ever seen. With respect to that wonderful film in its own way, this one is perhaps even better.""Gerald's Game"" tells the story of Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) & Jessie (Carla Gugino) Burlingame, a middle-aged couple headed up to the lake cabin for a romantic weekend. Right from the get-go, it is clear this is a marriage on the rocks. To spice things up in the bedroom, Gerald brings along some handcuffs that Jessie reluctantly allows to be put on her as she is shackled to the bedposts. But then, the unthinkable happens...Gerald gets a bit too rough, Jessie strenuously objects, and Gerald suddenly clutches his chest and falls off the bed after having a heart attack. This puts Jessie in quite a predicament: alone in a secluded cabin, no one around for days, her husband dying on the floor, and her chained to the bed at the mercy of the elements, her bodily needs, and a meat-hungry stray dog that senses her ebbing strength. The clincher: The Moonlight Moon shows up at night (he is real...or a figment of her imagination?).What makes this such a compelling film is how it is able to to be legitimately creepy while also telling a very smart and relevant story. Jessie's predicament is terrifying in and of itself, but then things become more layered as the film flashes back to her childhood in order to better understand how she came to be in this marriage in the first place. It's such a spot-on glimpse at how past traumas can manifest themselves throughout one's life...until they have to be faced head on (e.g. the situation Jessie finds herself in on that bed). There is not a single wasted scene here, as everything has meaning either to the plot or character development.In all honest, I think ""Gerald's Game"" could be a big stepping stone for Netflix, as this is a movie that could have easily premiered in theaters across the country and made millions. It is not just ""good for a Netflix show"", but rather one of the top films I have seen in quite some time. The fact that Netflix was able to produce something of this utmost quality makes me trust them even more going forward.Thus, even with my high expectations (I loved the book, obviously), this adaptation has quickly cemented itself as one of the top movies I have ever seen. It tells a great story, has wonderful character development supported by terrific acting, and is legitimately unsettling at times even to seasoned cinema fans. If you have a Netflix subscription, this 100% needs to be in your queue.",5
Jessie,"I've read the book and thought it was nothing special. After reading it I thought it would never be filmed as it's basically 400 pages of a woman handcuffed to a bed. It would make for a boring film, right? And it does.It starts good, does nothing for an hour, then gets back on track. It is faithful to the book but that is where the problem lies. Well made, good acting but when nothing happens for an hour except flashbacks to other events then it becomes a struggle. Basically, it's an hour too long. Cut the boring hour long rambling and you will have a good film. As it is, this one will test your patience.",2
Jessie,"During my blast of reading all that was Stephen King in the mid-90's, I remember this novel as being the latest, up to that point, piece of writing I got my hands on before going into retirement as it were. I remember the yarn being well told but as you read most of King's output you start getting set pieces or plot through lines you've read before. Rabid dog on the loose, Cujo, check, incapacitated bed occupant, Misery, check & traumatic event occurring on the day of a solar eclipse, Dolores Clairbourne, check anew. We now have the filmed version of Gerald's Game whereby a loveless married couple trying to rekindle their union w/a pair of handcuffs soon open the floodgates of calamity & terrifying claustrophobia. Sparsely acted & directed, the film works in fits & starts w/the bedroom scenes near soundless except for the seemingly unending dialogue which paints things a little much the obvious. The denouement involving a mysterious bogeyman feels forced & unnecessary given everything else which has come before that it threatens to capsize the entirety of the exercise.",2
Jessie,"Stephen King's books are hit or miss when adapted and this one is a big miss. I have not read the book yet, but I have read many of the early stuff, from Carrie to Misery. Shawshank Redemption is the best film, closely followed by Dead Zone and The Green Mile. A woman and her husband have a little getaway to try to rekindle their failing marriage and the man handcuffs his better half to the bed. He pops a blue pill and promptly drops dead. Pfizer may have a lawsuit on its' hands here. The following hour and a half are a drag as the woman has long and tedious conversations with her dead husband and with a version of herself. A bad relationship with dad are shown through flashbacks and none of it works. I was bored to tears.",2
Jessie,"I don't care if this was originally written by Stephen King and how faithful the film really is to the book. The film is garbage. That's how it is. Its script is so dumb and doesn't know what it wants to be. It starts as a drama and then turns into a thriller and adventure. The husband handcuffs his wife to the bed to have hardcore sex with her. They get in argument and he dies. Now it's up to the woman to survive while she is tied to the bed while the dog eats his husband's corpse on the floor. After this point the movie is full of fillers. Pacing issues, pointless background stories, hilarious hallucinations and boring dialogues are everywhere. The film has some good moments which prevented me from giving it 1/10 but other than that it's a complete mess. And don't even get me started on dumb ending. As I stated earlier. The film begins as drama then turns into a thriller and adventure. In the end it becomes a horror film. Turns out she was not hallucinating and Ghoul was real all along. Then once she gets out of the bed, as a narrator she explains ghoul's character for several minutes as it the film was all about ghoul. And in the end it turns out that the ghoul was actually a human with some disease that made him look like a ghoul. What is the point of this film? 3/10.",2
Jessie,"Gerald's Game made me ponder over a lot of things - cases of incest and abusive husbands that fill up our newspapers every day, the event of the solar eclipse, the presence of something sinister (in the dark of the night), and introspection during arduous situations - Mike Flanagan (directing from a screenplay by himself and Jeff Howard, based on a Stephen Kind novel) connects these dots magnificently in a crisp psychological horror-thriller than runs for 105 minutes. Right from the opening shot (of handcuffs being loaded onto a satchel), we sense the oddness. And it doesn't really surprise when the husband (Gerald, played by Bruce Greenwood) dies of cardiac arrest just when a quarrel ensues before the couple proceed to have BDSMic sex (in an attempt to revive their sexual lives) at their remote lake-house, because Flanagan has already mastered the skill of putting his lead character/(s) in uncomfortable situations (Absentia, Oculus, Hush & Ouija sequel). So, I guess the novel was tailor-made for him to direct. However, I should also mention that this movie veers away from the usual ""trapped-person"" conventionalities.Here's a woman (Jess, played by the brilliant Carla Gugino) who's left handcuffed to her bed (yes both hands), unable to even move about. But the movie *actually begins* a little later: a stray dog (whom Jess had fed earlier) walks into the room and bites off a piece of flesh from Gerald's corpse. Then, the hallucinations commence - Jess sees a version of herself, her husband and at times, the story intermittently dives into flashback mode, to the time when she was a little girl, and was vacationing with her parents during the occurrence of a rare kind of solar eclipse.Spoilers should end right about here. One'd wonder by reading the synopsis given on the IMDb page that this one will be another survival thriller on the lines of 'Hush' or 'Buried', but that's not all it is. The mystery around Jess' survival is indeed the spine of the film though there's plenty more to chew on. She discusses with the hallucinatory version of her (dead) husband on what had transpired in the couples' lives, and how they'd slowly drifted apart from each other - the conversation she should've had with him when he was alive and well. Every time the dramatic element kicks in, Flanagan reminds us that this film is as real as it is fictional. Jess will have to stretch herself to keep the blood circulation going, drink water to sustain, and shoo away the dog when it tries to chomp on her.The 'Moonlight Man' was a well conceived addition to the goings-on: a sense of gloom prevails, apparently personifying Death itself. The flashbacks provide extensive character development (in a situation where Jess can do nothing but examine her own thoughts and feelings). The final act is on a different plateau altogether: gorehounds should be pleased, but it somehow didn't strike a chord with me. The narration that followed (revealing a plot-twist) also felt out-of-place for a film that had almost stuck to its old-school storytelling roots. I'd say the movie peaks during those stretches where lines between fantasy and reality begin to blur.Flanagan sees to it that some of the ghastly images that unfold on screen remain with the viewer for a very long time: the Moonlight Man's smile, the color of the surroundings during solar eclipse, ripping a palm open using a piece of glass, the pervasive glances of the dad and the apathetic gestures of the husband..everything leaves a dubious impression.Verdict: Well-executed psychological thriller with a befuddled finale!",4
Jessie,"I'm sitting in bed (how fitting) relaxing on a Saturday, and I just finished watching Gerald's Game, wishing I could get those 2 hours back. Let me just say that this film was diabolical, actually painful to sit through so much so that I should have turned it off. If you decide to watch it and think maybe it will get better don't. It gets worse. Also this may come as a surprise, because the first 10 minutes of the film are actually quite promising, I was thinking it was going to be great. But it is after the first 10 minutes (not long) where you will understand why this story has been deemed one that would be impossible to translate to film. No spoilers but a concept is introduced which just does not work for film and is actually very tedious. Anyway I'm just glad its over, I hope to never think about it again, and neither should you!",1
Jessie,"Before we get into the fact that 99% of the movie occurred in her mind, we have to point out that she barely tried to escape. It was laughable! She pulled on the cuffs right away at the beginning, but then barely tried again. ""Reinforced"" wood or not, those bed posts were NOT thick and sturdy. They were skinny and very very breakable.
Also, why not roll her feet/legs up over her head and kick at the bed posts? Why not try to grasp the bed post with a leg and yank? Why not try violent up-and-down bouncing to hopefully loosen something up?
I mean, why to try escape when you can just imagine people talking to you instead?",2
Jessie,"Well, maybe it cannot get much worse than being handcuffed to a bed, alone in a house, far from civilization. t.But that premise does not sound like something that would fill a full length movie with. However, if anything, it actually seems a bit short. Or at least a bit thin, so to speak. The movie clearly wants to tell a far deeper story than there is room for. And it clearly wants me to feel more than I do when watching it. And with a rushed ending I am left feeling very little, except for disappointment in that this could have been a truly frightening, emotional, and thought-provoking movie, but isn't.",3
Jessie,"I am going to address the elephant in the room. The movie sucks mostly because the plot sucks. It is a sick combination of goriness, perversion and moronic fantasies. I guess when a writer reaches to the status that King has, all he needs to do is apparently to puke some nonsense and be praised for it.",1
Prema Katha Chitram 2,"Like I said its a horror romantic comedy you should only watch when there's nothing else. The heroine is cute, her acting is pretty good. The start was a little confusing but okay. It was so stupid the way that guy died. In the first half the concept felt unique. The title song is quite catchy. It was not a particularly horrifying horror film but more of a comedy. The second half was where the movie took a plunge bringing it down to mediocrity. However you could pass some time watching this movie.",3
Prema Katha Chitram 2,"""Prema Katha Chitram"" is a 'run-of-the-mill' horror film where the script is as similar as every horror film subjects. But the director had tried to show some difference in the film by mixing comedy elements in the film. Unfortunately, the comedy mix as well as horror part does not really work out.The screenplay looked so childish and artificial that no where the film showed realism. Thereby, the film failed to scare the audience.The whole cast really have doomed the film by their overacting, while the female lead Nandita Raj is the only saving grace (performance wise). Overall this is a film that you have to make it a miss !",2
Prema Katha Chitram 2,I loved this movie so much that I watched it again immediately the next day. My 8 year old daughter also loves it. It was so so funny and romance was really neat. The songs I am still crazy and the best songs of the year. Heroines action is too good for a second movie. The comedians were very very good too. Lot of relief not to see Brahmi. The story line is very fresh and innovative. Definitely deserves to be a block buster. Great relief from the formula movies with nasty fights. The screenplay and back ground music and photography are all good. I wish people recognized the director as Prabhakar Reddy rather than Maruthi.,5
Prema Katha Chitram 2,"This is definitely one of the most entertaining movies that I have seen in recent times. The story is fresh and amusing. The dialogs get one BIG thumbs up from my side. The acting by Praveen and Saptagiri get two BIG thumbs up from my side. The choice of the girl(Nandita) was good with her beautiful eyes that did most of the job for her. Sudheer could have done a better job is what I felt. I started watching the movie expecting something but it turned out to be completely different, not that I am complaining. It was fully satisfying, thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The best part is my 3-year old son also enjoyed watching the movie. Watch this movie...and have fun!!!",4
Free Solo,"No, I'm not inspired to free climb El Capitan or any slope. I'm an 84 year old retired businessman still trying to figure out how to best live my life, and I left the theater last night in awe of Alex Honnald's achievement -- climbing an almost vertical granite wall in a little over three hours when, in any second, the slightest mistake would result in death.Watching Alex do it -- watching the joy in his face when he got beyond some of the most difficult challenges as well as on the top,\; watching the intense focus and concentration as he sought safe holds; watching what I read as his quiet determination and confidence when he approached the wall for his solo climb -- these images will be with me for the balance of my life.They will return to me when I need focus and concentration in the moment to achieve something. They will return to me when I need to build confidence and determination to achieve a goal. They will return to me as I examine and release thoughts of fear that I conjure up (but I'm not blessed, as Alex is, with an amygdala that does not respond to fear inducing visions).Thank you, Alex, for the powerful inspiration.",5
Free Solo,"I've wanted to see this film since I first heard it was being made. Reading about the soloing of El Cap in the summer of 2017, I was riveted. The film is just as, if not more, powerful than the best articles at the time.Alex Honnold is, well, a bit of a weirdo, but I would not expect less from someone who has achieved something no other human being has. As he says at one point in the movie, ""No one who is comfortable and cozy has ever achieved anything great.""The sequences of him climbing are extraordinary, terrifying, emotional, moving and awe-inspiring. Not just the sequences of El Cap, but all around the world.But, there is so much more: his relationship with his family, his friends, and girlfriend are ... complicated. His recipe for potato-spinach-chili is sublime, and the method by which he consumes his food ... unique.Go see this movie now! Why don't distribution companies release movies like this wider? I had to drive 30 miles to see it instead of 2 miles to my local cinema. Not everyone wants to see CGI-heavy superhero movies, especially when real superheroes exist.",5
Free Solo,By far one of the best horror films I have ever seen.,5
Free Solo,"This movie shows the humanity, insanity, and personal struggle for perfection it takes to do things that no one else has done and few to none have tried to accomplish. Possible the best movie I have ever seen in terms of drawing you in, keeping a strangle hold on your attention, and not just rushing to the juicy parts but letting you savor the journey. 
Alex Honnold you are an inspiration to the world. Never stop. 
""What you are afraid to do is a clear indicator of the next thing you need to do."" -Ralph Waldo Emerson",5
Free Solo,"You had me at ""Jimmy Chin"", and ""El Cap"", so I checked out the trailer, and it looked pretty good. However I was unprepared for the reality. Trailers so often pick out some highlights and leave an expectation which is left unfulfilled.The trailer didn't prepare me for the way this doc is crafted, the sequencing, the steady relentless buildup of emotion.The trailer didn't prepare me for the visceral anxiety of the film crew, their inability to watch the viewfinder as Alex performed crux moves which could have resulted in him plummeting out of frame. The close ups of Alex's fingers on nubs if rock, his climbing shoes relying on tiny irregularities to retain grip, and his perfectly balanced moves displayed the craft of his skills. Non rock-climbers will learn an appreciation from watching this and climbers will revel.I had no idea that I'd have to will myself to breathe to survive this movie, despite knowing the successful outcome.I also had no expectation that I'd have to fight back tears during a documentary to stop them obscuring my vision.Alex's achievement is extraordinary, as is the crafting of this movie. A documentary like no other. I've pre-ordered it so I can repeat the experience as often as I can stand it.Incidentally, if you have the equipment to watch 360 video on YouTube, such as the PlayStation PSVR, there's a brief 360 promo called, I think, Free Solo 360. Experiencing hanging in space part way up El Cap is quite something.",5
Free Solo,"Coincidentally, our family did a hiking vacation in Yosemite a week after Alex Honnald did this climb. I knew nothing about climbing but our guided hike took us to the top of El Capitan. I was unable or unwilling to get within 100 yards of the edge - since at 101 yards there was a 3000 foot cliff.That someone climbed this face without ropes (Ok, or with ropes) amazes me and I have been waiting for this movie since I heard about its production. It is a documentary and while you know the end before it starts, it is still one of the more suspenseful movies I've seen.",5
Free Solo,"""Free Solo"" (2018 release; 96 min.) is a bio-pick about Alex Honnold and his historic 2017 climb of Yosemite's El Capitan. As the movie open, we see Alex in the later stage of that climb, and the images immediately will cause you to gasp. We then go back to ""Spring 2016"", when Alex is doing a book tour and comments about why he does what he does. ""Chances of falling off are low, but the consequences are high"", he wryly observes. Ater a few minutes recapping Alex's upbringing, it isn't long before the movie centers on El Capitan, ""the center of the rock-climbing universe""... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from (real life couple) Jimmy Chan and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, who previously brought us the equally excellent ""Meru"", one of my favorite movies of 2014. Here they document the extraordinary feat accomplished by Alex Hannold of conquering the 3,200 ft. El Capitan. While the movie does well putting everything into the proper context, in particular Alex's budding relationship with his new girlfriend, what makes this so remarkable is that we, the audience at large (whom I suspect are not experts in rock climbing, let alone free solo climbing) are shown how technical and challenging it is to climb up El Capitan, let alone doing it free solo. Alex does many trial runs to grasp and master the most difficult parts of the climb. The last half hour brings us the actual free solo climb (on June 3, 2017), and even though we know the outcome (Alex lives!), it is still stupefying and almost impossible to watch (I admit I covered my eyes on a number of occasions). There are simply no words for it.""Free Solo"" opened in late September in limited release, and immediately caused a sensation. The movie finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED to the rafters in the largest room of the 6 screen theater, something I haven't seen in YEARS. The movie is going to be a box office smash in the art-house theater circuit, and sure to be nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar. Whether you have any interest in rock climbing or not, if you want to see one of the greatest human achievements in sports or you are a thrill-seeker, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",5
Free Solo,Took my 9yo who occasionally climbs with me and she really dug it.,5
Free Solo,"Having been a climber for over 30 years, I can entirely understand and appreciate what's going on inside of the spirit. Having gone up El Cap myself, I can entirely feel the enormity of this endeavor shown in this film.
However, I know how hard it is to climb at a 5.12 level, let alone a 5.13. Even a 5.11 goes beyond the imagination of most human beings on this planet. And I'm still talking ""being roped up and safe"".
Now accepting the thought of free soloing anything at 5.11 and above, even for just a hundred feet, chapeau to those who have the mental strength and physical preparedness to do so.
However, what Honnold did, free soloing at up to 5.13 and on over 3000 feet of rock, goes beyond comprehension.
Also, I'd like to share my entire appreciation to the film crew, as I'm entirely aware of the logistical challenges one has to manage to capture something like this film has shown us.
Having friends on the wall, who met them on the wall, I also know that the film crew and Honnold had to go up the wall several times again. Truly incredible, the dedication they all put into this, I just can't find words to describe.
It's hard to say if this will ever be done again.
For sure I can say that this is the highest ever accomplishment in sports of mankind ever and I'm so thankful that this documentary has been able to share it with us.",5
Free Solo,"It delves into the mental and physical struggle of achieving an almost impossible feat to FREE SOLO, Yosemite's El Capitan the greatest slap of granite in the world!

Free Solo,"Like others reviewers mention, they could have reduced the time spent on Alex's relationship with his girlfriend. I didn't mind her, but I was just not into that aspect of the story.Alex's notes were fascinating. Using that as a base, I wish they would have expanded on the terminology and techniques behind rock climbing. I am a layman and I was interested in the little bit that they showed in the film.I also thought the final climb was a bit too short. I understand that they didn't want to smother Alex with cameras while doing a precarious climb. Nevertheless, I think they could have shown some of the easier parts of the climb to give a sense of the time and endurance required.In any case, I found Free Solo to be interesting and recommend the documentary.",4
Free Solo,"I really enjoyed the first part of the movie. But after a while I became nervous, because the movie was moving on and on but he still hadn't start climbing. Exactly 20 minutes before the movie was over, he finally began to climb. The whole climbing scene took only 10-15 minutes. That's just way to short. I have no idea what the producers were thinking. But you can't make a movie or documentary or whatever about one of the greatest achievements in climbing, maybe even sport history and give his girlfriend more sceentime than the climb itself.",4
Free Solo,"As many people stated, the documentary is pretty awesome. Alex is a driven, focused climber and all around achiever. It's nice to finally see more of his private life, how he thinks, how he functions. But the portions about his relationship with his girlfriend spoils the whole experience quite a bit. Instead of a motivational input in his life, she is constantly nagging, bringing down the flow of energy to a halt, not participating in his achievements or drive towards them; she constantly puts a break on his effort to go forward. For as deep, selfless and introvert as Alex is, which is what is amazing to me in the first place, his girlfriend is the complete opposite on screen: she seems shallow, self absorbed and seemingly driven by getting Alex to let go of what makes him extraordinary to become more open, less of a dreamer and settle down to what is life according to her. I assume her personality is what attracts Alex, opposites attract, and that's fine, but as far as what makes a documentary about an exceptional feat done by an exceptional person, it makes for poor screen time.",5
Free Solo,"I enjoyed watching this movie. The footage of free solo climbing gives adrenaline and sweaty hands. The glimpses into Alex' personality and relations with his family and girlfriend are interesting. And even more interesting are his reflections on life and death, that he has to consider when doing something so dangerous.But I think the movie gives too little time to these interesting parts, and somewhere in the middle of the movie, when he and his girlfriend is looking at a house, I find myself bored. I was also left unsatisfied by the part involving the climb itself, giving too little time to show the amazing footage of the climb, and instead changing camera angles at a fast rate accompanied by dramatic music.It is like the directors felt the need to emphasize how dramatic and thrilling the climb was, instead of letting the audience decide for themselves. I believe most people understand that climbing a steep hill with few grips, without any rope, has a huge risk. And the filming itself is breathtaking",3
Free Solo,This is the best documentary I have ever seen. It takes you inside the mind and life of one of the world's best rock climbers. The visuals are incredible. You get to feel a bit what it is like to climb what to most of us would be a blank vertical wall rock wall overlooking heaven.,5
Free Solo,"It's a great movie. I usually rate 10/10 only a couple movies per year. This is one of them. It's just mind-blowing how dangerous and hard what's he's done. And what's important, it's not one of the things that seems hard for outsiders, but is actually not hard when you have a lot of experience in the subject. This achievement is unbelieveably hard even for the best professional climbers, as you can hear from Alex's friend's words, who is one of the best climbers in the world.
But I wouldn't rate it 10 just for climbing achievement. I was impressed by the Alex's general attitude to life. His passage about happiness in life is remarkable. ""Nothing great is achieved when people are happy and cozy. Life is not about happiness, it's about performance."" I feel this is so wise and true.
The movie itself is beautifully shot. The cinematography is amazing. It gives a very pleasant feeling when you see the gorgeous views of Yosemite, especially when you live in San Francisco and actually go to Yosemite a few times a year.
The pace of the movie is nice, and it gains more and more suspense over time. When you watch Alex actually climbing El Capitan free solo, you're on the edge of the seat. You see how small the holds are and the feeling of excitement and anxiety overwhelms you (some people were even lightly moaning in the theater). You already know the outcome, but you still can't believe he will make it.
But he does.",5
Free Solo,"Amazing filmmaking. A unique documentary that grips you and holds you till the end. It was funny, heartbreaking and inspiring. I can't wait to see it again.",5
Free Solo,"A portrait of an extraordinary man with singular purpose, whose life is nearly irreversibly derailed by an obtuse, obnoxious, and painfully ignorant (albeit admittedly hot) young woman.It was difficult to keep one's eyes on the screen scene whenever the girlfriend, Sanni, appeared. She is clearly unable to understand what it means to have a passion in life, to care about a purpose greater than oneself. All she thinks and talks about is herself - and despite causing our climber to injure himself twice, continues to pester him with her self-indulgent childish nonsense.If she hadn't had the good sense to leave before his big climb (and one wonders whether it was really of her own accord, or thanks to the nudging of the filmmakers), the climb likely would have either never happened or ended in disaster.It was truly breathtaking to see the actual climb on film, especially in IMAX - and the cinematography and production quality is top notch. But for the preceding hour and half, by focusing on his girlfriend for so much of the film, and trying to frame their superficial relationship as something actually meaningful to him detracted from this film. Made much of this ""documentary"" feel obnoxious at best, and dishonest at worst, for the sake of satisfying some glib romantic plot desire from the studio/producers.",0
Free Solo,"A rousing, crowd-pleasing documentary that showcases the extraordinary capacity of the human body to push itself to the extreme - or in the words of free solo climber Alex Honnold, ""to reach perfection"" - Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi's FREE SOLO makes for one of the most tense viewing experiences I've had in a theater this year. We already know how this documentary will end (any other sort of ending and this would have never been released), but Chin and Vaserhelyi nonetheless manage to convey a palpable sense of fear and tension throughout, as Honnold repeatedly practices climbs in preparation for his free solo climb of Yosemite's famed El Capitan, a 3,000 foot wall of sheer granite. Honnold makes for a fascinating subject as the climber at the heart of the story. Unlike literally 99% of other climbers, however, Honnold specializes in free soloing - climbing without using ropes or any other sort of protection. What Honnold does is insane, and the film repeatedly stresses the fact that one wrong move would result in his death. But Honnold's passion for free soloing is his lifeblood, and despite the inherent (and obvious) dangers of his profession, it's the one thing that keeps him going. I can't imagine what would ever possess Honnold (and others like him) to do what they do, but what I can say is that FREE SOLO captures his feats in breathtaking glory that left the audience in the theater cheering at the end.Points off for the Tim McGraw song during the end credits, though.",4
Free Solo,I would rather watch a 4 hour video of the ascent with Honnold's commentary.,2
Free Solo,Fascinating story but the fact the the girlfriend got more screen-time than the actual climb destroyed the whole movie.,2
Free Solo,"I was waiting with baited breath for the documentary to show Alex training, climbing, and progressing to the final epic climax of conquering El Capitan. And i was waiting, and waiting, and waiting...
Not only was the lack of climbing frustrating, it was doubly frustrating cause the climbing was replaced by his annoying girlfriend and her feelings. Which is possibly the last thing I'd want to be watching.
I understand that romances are an integral part of stories and movies, and there's obviously a demand for it in general considering the amount of it on TV and the big screen.
But in a documentary about climbing El Capitan free solo. One of the most amazing, scary, and difficult tasks someone has ever done. For 90% of the movie to be about their relationship and the emotional disconnect between Alex's climbing and his girlfriend, with footage of them doing mundane things, rather than the climb, preparation, and background/history of Alex and his climbing, is just the most underwhelming things i have ever watched regarding mountaineering.
So disappointing.",1
Free Solo,"A documentary about climbing solo up sheer vertical cliffs without safety ropes sounds too crazy-masculine to contain a gentle story of emotional awakening. While Free Solo (2018) celebrates athletic triumph it is also a thoughtful essay on mortality, fear, and self-identity, as it probes into the heart and mind of an elite athlete in an extreme sport.By his mid-30s, Alex Honnold had achieved a world-class reputation for solo climbing, but despite his achievements, he was taunted by the unconquered El Capitan cliff face of Yosemite National Park. Together with an expert team of photographer climbers, he sets about the rigorous physical and mental preparation for the 3000 feet ascent. For most of the film, we watch him planning and repeatedly climbing El Capitan with safety gear, while documenting every single step and manoeuvre needed for what would be an historic free solo to the top.While this simple, linear narrative is predictable from the outset, the photography and character study are sublime. Panoptic drones capture close-ups of Alex on vertical granite walls, showing breathtaking toeholds in tiny recesses that barely grip. During the arduous preparation, Alex has an MRI scan that reveals an inert amygdala...a part of the brain that regulates emotion. Coming from a broken home and obsessed in his pursuit of climbing perfection, Alex has no fear and is emotionally closed. The only fear shown in the film is felt by his crew who must mentally rehearse the possibility that they will witness a close friend's death. The hitherto accident-free athlete enters a relationship with the emotionally warm, wise, and beautiful Sanni McCandless, and for the first time he experiences fall injuries.With an easy broad smile, wide eyes, and vulnerable humility, Alex is a very likeable young man. His blossoming relationship with Sanni unfolds with childlike simplicity and growing emotional responsibility, while they are both aware that free soloing El Capitan means Alex will always be one slip from certain death. This fly-on-the-wall documentary eavesdrops on a few private moments to reveal a dilemma: Alex's dormant emotional self is being stirred, but he must overcome it to face what is a super-human challenge.Some viewers will notice the unbounded selfishness required to put others through the stress of Alex's personal pursuit while he is relatively free from the constraints of human emotion. Others will see Alex as a heroic protagonist in his own tortured life journey, or maybe wonder what bravery means if one feels no fear. No doubt there are other viewpoints and readings of this film. Regardless of what message you take, this is a riveting story, brilliantly filmed amongst some of the most stunning mountain scenery you will ever see.",4
Junglee,"--------
Raj Nayar (Vidyut Jammwal), a veterinary doctor from Mumbai, visits his father after a long gap of ten years in their Chandrika elephant sanctuary (Odisha). Soon after, a ghastly attack on the elephants by a bunch of poachers, led by (Atul Kulkarni), changes his life forever.Initially lured by the city life, Raj now decides to protect the gentle giants in the sanctuary, which has always been his father's dream. After a series of unfortunate events that happen in the reserve, Meera (debutante Asha Bhat), a journalist from Mumbai and Shankara (debutante Pooja Sawant), a mahout based in the sanctuary, also join Raj's mission of punishing the illegal hunters, who kill elephants for ivory.Protect animals, save the elephants is the primary message that Junglee sends across and it does so in an action-packed way. The film also reiterates that if we pledge to stop buying ivory products, it will prevent poachers from indulging in this illegal trade. True to its theme, the film transports you to the calm of a jungle, away from your city, cell phones and chaos (shot in the beautiful locales of an elephant reserve in Thailand).Known for Hollywood blockbusters like The Mask, The Scorpion King and Eraser, American director Chuck Russell makes his Hindi cinema debut with this one. His fascination for mythology, Hindu mantras, our martial arts like Kalaripayattu and Lord Ganpati is evident, given the Indian essence and exoticism he brings to the story.While the film scores higher on action than emotion, Russell's attempt at blending the two with a social cause, stands out for a variety of reasons.All the actors exude effortless comfort around the elephants, which is rare for an Indian film that revolves around animals. The last Indian film that captured the man-elephant camaraderie was Haathi Mere Saathi (1971), starring Rajesh Khanna.The film's highlight, other than its fight against poachers who kill elephants for tusks, is Vidyut Jammwal's brilliance as one of our finest action heroes. His action is absolutely flawless and perhaps the best in the business. The jaw-dropping, lethal action scenes he portrays on screen and his mastery in martial arts puts him at par with the finest action heroes across the globe.Action sequences that holds your attention and makes this film a paisa vasool entertainer, that is bound to attract families and children.Such an adventurous and brave attempt is rare in Hindi cinema.",4
Junglee,So basically a rip-off of Tony Jaa's Tom yum goong.,2
Junglee,"JUNGLEE REVIEW :There are multiple films made on the same story of jungle where Human's hunger for money destroys forrest world. The Animal comes in mind in that story is most probably an Elephant who is more profitable for hunters. It's been almost 30 years we haven't seen a film on the same old story and here comes Junglee loaded with New Action Mania. The same old story does feel predictable but the action sequences and new set of storytelling makes it a decent watch.Juglee is the same predictable story revolving around Eliphant hunting, and later turning into a Revenge drama. Vidyut Jammwal, Pooja Sawant, Asha Bhat, Atul Kulkarni, Makarand Deshpande and rest of the cast members plays thier roles fine on screen. A Writer should have tried to write something new so that film would have looked more interesting. Screenplay is Tight and that's why film never looks dull or boring. Action and stunts are eye pleasing and the Camera Work is well supporting. Chuck Russell as Director fails to bring some special product, but thank god he doesn't deliver a crap.If you real feel for the animals then Junglee will hit your chords very well, apart from that it is still a very entertaining cinematic experience. But if you are looking for something more than a Decent product then wait, keep those expectations well in limit. The emotional touch of Animals may tug little rings in your heart and the Action mania towards the End works on high note. Overall, Junglee is a Good One Time Watch or rather a decent watch for all kind of Audiences, no matter what your taste is, no matter what your age is.RATING- 5/10*",3

Junglee,Best action scene and vidud is osm and nice camera work,5
Junglee,"Vidyut Jammwal flexes his muscles and does a bunch of entertaining stunts at the start and the end of Junglee (Wild), a crime drama with a social message about animal (tuskers) and nature conservation that is extremely similar to most films and documentaries about animal and nature conservation. TN.",2
Junglee,"It's a must watch movie for Martial arts and nature lovers, the movie not only entertains you with it's action but also has beautiful locations good acting good music and a message as well",5
Junglee,Guys just don't listen to the critics.They r misleading u.If u want to have some fun with your kids and family then there can't be a better way than junglee.Go for a 2 hour greenish relief..,5
Junglee,Copying other movies. and have some very bad agenda. Vidyut is promoting those agendas because he belong to Hindu Nationalist family. Also poorly choreographed action scenes makes the movie worst. Specially bike scene and showing totally impossible mad scenes makes it more than worst.,1
Junglee,"Don't be fool by other 3 review. I don't think they watch this movie. It's one of the worst movie of this month. No story. Director not sure what he is doing. Not entertaining at all. I wanted to getting out from hall in middle. But I didn't just because the seat of the hall was too comfy. Don't waste your money here. If you want entertainment then watch ""kesari"". If you want good story and making watch ""Badla"".",1
Junglee,"The daring Vidyut Jamwal rocks.......This movie was something we haven't seen before in Bollywood......Awesome cinematography, actions and effects.....This is worth spending money......",5
Junglee,"They are all associated with the movie. This is the worst directed movie I have seen - almost childish. We saw people leaving in the middle, but I decided to just sleep through. I wonder why would they waste so much money on locations, camera work and not worry about story, dialogs, direction or even editing??",1
Junglee,"After seen ' Junglee', I admit that Bollywood movie never reached at standard of Hollywood movie, even it directed by Hollywood director. Chuck Russell tried his best but he doesn't succeed to overcome from Bollywood saga. Yes, ' Junglee' is a typical Bollywood movie by Hollywood director Chuck Russel. There is nothing new in story. Movie is only watchable for Elephants and electrified action from Vidyut Jamawal. I thought that the movie would be same as 'The Protector' starring Tony Jaa, but it is far different. As me it could be made remake of it and could be better. Thanks to director / music director that there are no lazy boring love songs here. Acting by Vidyut is ok, but action is super. Leading lady is only for fill the gap of leading female. Atul Kulkarni is perfect but at last he looses his tempo and looks helpless. Vidyut's father is totally miscast. For such a martial artist son, father should be strong and impressive. Another miscast is Makrand Deshpande, the teacher should have perfect and believable. Direction neither is just okaying, not memorable nor twists side. As suggested by me just watch for elephants (especially for kids in their summer vacation) and Vidyut Jamawal's action. One more plus point is that the camerawork. It is excellent to catch the beauty of natures like mountains, woods, and lakes and of course about elephants too!
A rare movie from Bollywood on elephants after ' Haathi Mere Saathi', Main aur mera Hathi and 'Sufed Hathi'. Good try...and best message that ' Love animals and love natures'.!!!",4
Junglee,"Lord of the junglee
Raj Nayar (Vidyut Jammwal), a veterinary doctor from Mumbai, visits his father after a long gap of ten years in their Chandrika elephant sanctuary (Odisha). Soon after, a ghastly attack on the elephants by a bunch of poachers, led by (Atul Kulkarni), changes his life forever.

Protect animals, save the elephants is the primary message that Junglee sends across and it does so in an action-packed way. The film also reiterates that if we pledge to stop buying ivory products, it will prevent poachers from indulging in this illegal trade. True to its theme, the film transports you to the calm of a jungle, away from your city, cell phones and chaos (shot in the beautiful locales of an elephant reserve in Thailand).Known for Hollywood blockbusters like The Mask, The Scorpion King and Eraser, American director Chuck Russell makes his Hindi cinema debut with this one. His fascination for mythology, Hindu mantras, our martial arts like Kalaripayattu and Lord Ganpati is evident, given the Indian essence and exoticism he brings to the story, from a Westerner's perspective.While the film scores higher on action than emotion, Russell's attempt at blending the two with a social cause, stands out for a variety of reasons. Along with cinematographer Mark Irwin (known for RoboCop 2), the director manages to capture the enormous animals in their natural habitat. Thankfully, there is no cutesy, orchestrated acting that the elephants are made to do, and they are a sight to behold. All the actors exude effortless comfort around the elephants, which is rare for an Indian film that revolves around animals. The last Indian film that captured the man-elephant camaraderie was Haathi Mere Saathi (1971), starring Rajesh Khanna and Tanuja.The film's highlight, other than its fight against poachers who kill elephants for tusks, is Vidyut Jammwal's brilliance as one of our finest action heroes. His action (without the help of a body double) is absolutely flawless and perhaps the best in the business. The jaw-dropping, lethal action scenes he portrays on screen and his mastery in martial arts puts him at par with the finest action heroes across the globe. A police station scene in particular, where a handcuffed Vidyut single-handedly dodges the cops, is spectacular. You see him fling himself on running vehicles, indulging in fist fights, and sliding through a tiny window and more. It's Chung Chi Li (who has worked with Jackie Chan in the Rush Hour franchise, and movies like Shanghai Noon and The Tuxedo, among others) and Parvez Shaikh's pulsating action that holds your attention and makes this film a paisa vasool entertainer, that is bound to attract families and children.Though Asha and Pooja, in their small parts, make confident and decent debuts. Atul makes his presence felt as the antagonist, who looks at killing mighty animals as a challenge. Understated and genuine, Akshay Oberoi and Makarand Deshpande are impressive in their parts, too.
Watch Junglee for its spellbinding action, cute elephants and gorgeous jungles. Such an adventurous and brave attempt is rare in Hindi cinema.",4
Junglee,Just a fight without emotional purpose and weak opponent makes it pointless. And story is very paper thin,2
Junglee,"I love this movie.
Nice story, well framed in Jungle and Indian cultural environment.
Best in showing action
Best in explaining family values.
Best in showing love for family and animals around us.
This is one of the best Bollywood movie in recent times.",5
Junglee,Se who are saying that it is a 'tyg' rip off are seriously dumb bcause movie script have no similarity with 'tyg' . its good entertainer .,5
Junglee,"A very good message to stop Animal Killing,
And ivory smuggling.
Best Movie for Nature Lovers,Animals Lovers.
Some of the scenes are very adorable and beautiful.
This Movie is mainly dedicated to Natures,Animal,wild life,Indian martial arts(kalaripayattu).
Indian Martial Art (kalaripayattu) is the oldest martial arts and the origin of Kungfu.",5
Vinci Da,"I can't say I was blown away by The Da Vinci Code - as is often the  case, the book was far superior. I generally like Tom Hanks in almost  all his roles, however I found that I had such a pre-conception of what  Robert Langdon should be, that it took me about half an hour to get  used to Hanks occupying this character. Once I settled into it  though - it was a thoroughly enjoyable, occasionally slow moving  thriller. Having read the book, I did have a knowledge of the various  groups and factions involved - I'm not sure how someone who hasn't read  the book will fair though.  The casting of the movie is surely one of it's stronger points - Paul  Bettany is almost unrecognisable and plays the menacing single minded  Silas to utter perfection. Sir Ian McKellan too, it totally fantastic,  and really steals most scene's he appears in. He delivers some great  one liners too - a real character actor playing a real character.  Audrey Tautou is as we have come to expect, just lovely, and who else  could have played Bezu Fache - Jean Reno was made for the role.  As you'd expect from a Ron Howard Production, there is a good amount of  cheese, especially towards the end. Langdon's ""Godspeed"" caused me to  awake in the night sweating!   I am a fairly harsh marker on the IMDb, so don't be put off by a 6 out  of 10 - I did enjoy the movie, but my anticipation was so great with  this film, that it could never live up to my expectation.",3
Vinci Da,"While he may not be the world's greatest writer, Dan Brown is an excellent storyteller, as judged by the millions of people who have read and enjoyed ""The Da Vinci Code"" - me included. So I was keenly anticipating the release of this movie, partly because I enjoyed the book and also because a number of scenes were shot in Lincoln Cathedral, which is my birthplace.First the good points. Ron Howard has chosen some great locations, and produced a sumptuously photographed film, with a thought-provoking, well-paced storyline which sticks pretty faithfully to the book. For me, Silas (Paul Bettany) is the strongest character in the film, graphically portrayed as a faithful servant of Opus Dei. His role is certainly one heck of a contrast with his recent leading role in Wimbledon!Unfortunately, for me those good points are outweighed by a wooden dialogue which poor old Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou have virtually no hope of making anything meaningful from. There is simply no chemistry between the 2 leading characters and some of their lines made me cringe because they were so embarrassingly weak. At no point did I feel involved in what should be a powerful and emotional story; it simply failed to engross me in any way. Bored is a strong word, but I was verging on it by the end.In summary, disappointing.",3
Vinci Da,"This movie is becoming as controversial as the book. Since the day it was announced that it's gonna be made, there were protests against it being done, and it has escalated to calls for boycotting, or banning the movie altogether. I'll not waste time and go into its controversies, nor discuss what's real and what's not. Neither will I explain in detail the plot, as I believe most of you readers would already have some vague idea of what it's about, or have read the book, since it's on the bestsellers list for months.Rather, I'll evaluate the movie as it is, on how well it entertains. Those who wish to preach in my comment box, prepare to have those comments deleted, at my discretion. This is the stand I shall take, that this movie is entirely fictional, based on events which are used loosely, for the sole purpose of weaving a storyline that tries to be believable. I think some have already mentioned it's too successful in doing that, and may mislead people into thinking its theories presented, are real. However, don't take it too seriously, and if you wish to, use another proper platform to debunk the myths, not my movie review blog.The structure of the movie, is exactly the same as the book. There is no change to the ending, despite some rumours that it will be different. Naturally, some of the detailed explanation that's given in the book, especially many three-way dialogue between Sophie- Robert-Leigh, have to be summarized in order to pace this movie into 2 1/2 hours. Herein lies the challenges. For those who've read the book, the movie offers nothing new, other than the gratification of watching events and characters play out on the big screen. For those who haven't read the book, the movie version should be decent enough to make you want to pick up the novel and read more into the controversial theories explained.However, having being familiar with the plot and how the story unfolds, red herrings, character motivations, twists and all, it may leave those who've read the novel, a page-turner in every sense of the word, a bit wanting, that the pace could've been improved. Undoubtedly the pacing sags when it's time for some dialogue heavy moments, but I suppose that is unavoidable when you're revisiting material.However, its presentation of these controversial dialogue moments coupled with special effects, that will make you go wow. Truly, the technique is nothing original, and some of the visuals used looked like Return of the King and Kingdom of Heaven rejects, but as a whole, combined with the narrative, it helps to present the controversies in a more palatable manner.Casting, I felt, was spot on. Tom Hanks makes Robert Langdon pretty accessible, given Hanks' everyman demeanor, and Audrey Tautou makes a believable Sophie Neveu. Ian McKellen, probably THE actor with 2 summer blockbusters back to back (the other being X- Men 3), is convincing as the rich grail hunter Sir Leigh Teabing. Paul Bettany is chilling as the albino killer Silas, and Jean Reno and Alfred Molina round up the star studded cast as the detective Captain Fache and Bishop Aringarosa.Much is said about the haunting soundtrack, but as far as I'm aware, there's nothing scary about it. Silas, in his scene of self-cleansing, is horrid enough though, as are some scenes of unexpected on screen violence that hit like a sack of potatoes falling from the sky.In the end, in spite of all the controversies, perhaps Robert Langdon's line is poignant - if given a chance, would you rather destroy faith, or renew it? The book and the movie have provided an opportunity for the faith to renew itself, to debunk the myths and theories (which were developed loosely to make the story flow of course), and to generally point the curious to the direction and light the faith wants to show.Otherwise, this Ron Howard movie makes a good summer popcorn flick, with the usual thrills and spills you'd come to expect with its superb production values.",4
Vinci Da,"First off, I'd just like to say that this movie is based on a fictional story. FICTION. Why people need to express hatred over this because of their religious beliefs is so mind-boggling. No one is saying that Christianity is wrong, and that this story is right. The book is classified as FICTION, not THEOLOGY! I should also note that my extremely religious Christian friends don't find this movie at all ""disturbing"" or ""wrong"". The fact is that if you believe in something, nothing -- including a movie, or story -- should be able to deter you from that belief. If you feel threatened by this movie or any other story like this, you have serious problems regarding the foundations in which you believe.Now, to the review... I'm not here to give you any spoilers or story info, since that's all been done in the other reviews.I have never read the book. I went to see the movie with my boyfriend, who read the book recently, and some friends (one of whom has read the book at least twice, and is so into the story that he has researched the symbols and meanings thoroughly and participates in Da Vinci Code games, forums, etc). So we actually had at least 3 differing perspectives here.I really loved the film. Having no story to compare it to, I didn't feel like I had to have read the book to understand the story. Nothing felt missing or incomplete. I came out of the theater ready to add this list to my favorites, and wanting to read the book to compare it to the movie.My boyfriend also thought the film was great. He said they did a great job adapting the book to film, and although not everything was there, they did the best that they could with the time they had, and he was impressed.My friend was so excited throughout the movie, he kept wanting to talk to us about it. He pointed out some things from the book that weren't there as well, but he understood it couldn't all be there. He also said that watching the film put a new perspective for him on the movie, since he imagined things looking and feeling different in his head. Seeing the movie allowed him to look at it differently, which made it exciting all over again.So, in summary, this seems to be a great movie no matter how deep you are into the Da Vinci Code. I normally wait for movies to go on DVD to rent, but this is one that I'd recommend you see in the theater... the atmosphere makes it more fun and also you can talk about this with others after seeing it, instead of catching up to everyone later and possibly getting spoilers before you watch. Again, I highly recommend this movie! A+",5
Vinci Da,"From the way the critics have gone after ""The Da Vinci Code,"" you'd think that Ron Howard himself had been jealously guarding the location of the Holy Grail all these years and was just now revealing it to all the world for his own nefarious (i.e. commercial) purposes. Actually, despite all the critical hostility and rancor, this turns out to be a reasonably entertaining adaptation of a reasonably entertaining novel, far from a classic or a work of art, but hardly the pile of cinematic refuse so many of the reviewers have led us to believe it is.As a work of history, the novel is a passel of nonsense, and only those with a bent towards conspiracy theory overload would be foolish enough to believe a minute of it. But as a work of imaginative fiction, ""The Da Vinci Code"" certainly gives its audience the neck-twisting workout they've paid good money to receive.It would be pointless to reiterate the plot of a novel that has probably had the biggest readership of any literary work since ""Gone With the Wind."" Suffice it to say that a mysterious murder in the Louvre sends a Harvard symbologist and the dead man's granddaughter on a clue-driven search for the famed Holy Grail. Along the way, the two uncover a grand conspiracy on the part of a renegade Catholic order to protect a secret that, if it were revealed, could shake the whole of Western civilization down to its very foundations.Despite the phenomenal - one is tempted to say ""unprecedented"" - commercial success of his work, Dan Brown is no great shakes as a writer; his characters are, almost without exception, drab and two-dimensional, and his dialogue, when it isn't being overly explicit in pouring out explanations, sounds like it was written by a first-year student in a Writer's 101 workshop. But the one undeniable talent Brown does have is his ability to knit together a preposterously complex web of codes and clues into an airtight tapestry, and to make it all convincing.The movie is very faithful to the novel in this respect. It moves quickly from location to location, never giving us too much time to question the logic (or illogic) of the narrative or to examine the many gaping plot holes in any great detail. Writer Akiva Goldsman has encountered his greatest trouble in the scenes in which the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters can lay out in laborious detail the elaborate story behind the clues. Yet, this is as much the fault of the nature and design of the novel as it is of the man given the unenviable task of bringing it to the screen. Moreover, perhaps in the interest of time and keeping the action flowing, Robert and Sophie come up with solutions to the myriad riddles much too quickly and accurately, with a ""Golly, gee, could it mean_______?"" attitude that borders on the ludicrous. But, somehow, Howard makes most of it work. Perhaps, it's the clunky literal-minded earnestness with which he approaches the subject that ultimately allows us to buy into it against our better judgment.Tom Hanks is stolid and passive as Dr. Robert Langdon, the college professor involuntarily driven into all this cloak-and-dagger intrigue, but Audrey Tautou has a certain subtle charm as Sophie, the woman who may play more of a part in the unraveling of the mystery than even she herself can imagine. Jean Reno and Paul Bettany have their moments as two of the less savory players in the story, but it is Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on all things related to the Holy Grail, who walks off with the film. His scenery-chewing shtick pumps some much needed life into a tale essentially populated by underdeveloped stick figures.The religious controversy surrounding both the novel and the film is as ludicrous as it is unjustified. Anyone whose belief system could be seriously shaken by this absurd mixture of unsubstantiated myth-making and plain old-fashioned wild speculation couldn't have had a very solid foundation of faith to begin with.The rest of us can appreciate ""The Da Vinci Code"" for what it is, an overblown but epic exercise in code-busting and clue-decoding - in short, the ""Gone With the Wind"" of whodunits.",4
Vinci Da,"Last Tuesday, when The Da Vinci Code premiered at the Cannes Film festival, it was met with a chilly reception from the reviewing elite. It has been called ""plodding,"" ""stale,"" and ""uninspired,"" thus, dashing the hopes of many movie goers who were hoping to see one of their favorite novels brought to life by one of their favorite directors, and starring one of their favorite actors. Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....First, I have to qualify myself. I read the book and I LOVED it; couldn't put it down. I loved the history, the speculation, the riddles and puzzles, and the masterful blend of fact and fiction. Additionally, I'm not religious, although I was definitely familiar with Christian historical icons such as Jesus, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdelene before I read the book. I also happen to be a big fan of Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Ian McKellan.Having said that, I went in prepared to like this movie, even though I had somewhat lowered my expectations based on the barrage of bad reviews. All of this proved to be a winning formula for me, apparently.If you're like me and you loved the book and you like the artistic team that pursued making it into a movie, then you'll most likely come out satisfied. You won't mind what many critics have called ""overly-long exposition"" and historical flashbacks, because that's pretty much what the book consisted of. And in the book, it was absolutely engrossing! So, I personally didn't mind all of the explanation of history, symbols, etc.Critics have also found fault with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's portrayals of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu (respectively), saying that they delivered flat performances. But once again, whoever read the book will remember that both of these characters weren't that dynamic on the written page, either. Of course, Sir Ian McKellan, with the juiciest role of Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, chews up the scenery every time he's shown on screen. Sir Leigh Teabing was also one of the richest characters in the book.I think that the people who won't like this movie are people who didn't read the book, and are going into the theater expecting a regular movie, which it's not. It's an adaptation of a very wordy, detailed, twisting, speculative novel that blends fact and fiction in a devastatingly effective way, and it's easy to get lost while watching the movie if you don't already know where the story is going. Sure, Ron Howard uses digitized, grainy flashbacks of ancient pagan rituals and societies to move the narrative along and to keep the audience on point, but I can see how it could be overwhelming to those who only know the bare bones of the plot. However, those who found it fascinating in the book will find pleasure in seeing the visual accompaniment to what they've already read.In short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly-held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development. It's a quest for the ""truth"", and in terms of the IDEAS expressed, they did a dag-blasted good job of translating those ideas onto the screen. Those who often complain that movies don't stay true to the books that they're based on will find comfort in the fact that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard have stayed incredibly close to the original text when translating it onto the screen. However, this will be to the dismay of those movie-goers who haven't read the book, and are therefore expecting a traditional action thriller with traditional action thriller dialogue.If you go to RottenTomatoes.com, you'll see the huge disparity between what the critics have said, and what the users have said regarding this film. While the cumulative critics rating is a dismal 22%, the combined user rating is a 74%, which is way above average for the site. That should speak volumes to whoever is skeptical about seeing the movie because of the bad reviews.The bottom line is that it's definitely a movie worth watching if only to see how the creative team behind it went about turning the best-selling novel into celluloid. It's also a treat to see something in popular culture challenge popular religious ideals so skillfully, even if only in the form of fiction.My advice: go see for yourself.",4
Vinci Da,"I've read the book, and the movie's not so bad. Obviously there are many things I'd do different, but in the end it's 2,5 hours of good entertainment, and isn't that what the ratings are all about? Personally I think Tom Hanks wasn't passionate enough for Robert Langdon. That's why it's not a 9 for me.A lot of people are too harsh on this one. Mostly because they know the book and have very high expectations. I have to see my first book-to-film where the film is better.Also, you're not going to hell for watching this movie or reading the book. It's based on a novel, which is based on a few loose theories, but in the end all it wants to do is to entertain. And that is exactly what both the book and the movie did for me.",4
Vinci Da,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the book - it had me hooked more than Harry Potter - and that's saying something (and no I'm not a 10 year old child)! After hearing about the critics' mainly negative views of the film, I approached it without high expectations, and for that, I was rewarded. What I got was an action-packed film that didn't let up until the dying minutes. This film is incredibly faithful to the book (I'm looking at you, Girl With a Pearl Earring!!) to the point where hardly anything is left out, and only minor things have been changed. The visuals are stunning, the acting of Hanks and Tautou is great - and contrary to certain critics opinions - I felt the emotional connection between them. As always, McKlellan is fun to watch, effortlessly bringing Teabing to life, and Reno suffices as Fache. Bettany is fantastic as Silas. The musical score was as good as the visual look of the film - it paired perfectly with the storytelling. Overall, I left the cinema feeling satisfied, because a great book had been turned into a really good film. Approach this film with little expectation, and you will enjoy the ride. Bravo Ron Howard, for doing such a good job.",5
Vinci Da,"If you take the most popular book in recent years, you should have the most popular movie since The Lord of the Rings, right? Wrong. Though the film was hotly debated, its cinematic quality and popularity aren't nearly as high as one would expect. Amid protests, pending lawsuits, and outright denouncements by Catholic officials, Ron Howard released his adaptation of Dan Brown's novel, The Da Vinci Code.American symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) are on a trans-European quest to solve riddles left by Louvre curator, Langdon's hero and Neveu's grandfather, Jacques Saunier, as he lay dying. The riddles and subsequent quest allegedly lead to the true identity and whereabouts of the famed Holy Grail. Hot in pursuit of the thinking man's Bonnie and Clyde is Javert-ian French police captain Bezu Feche (Jean Reno), intent on pinning the murder of Suanier on Langdon and Neveu, and albino monk, Silas (Paul Bettany) under the command of a mysterious telephone voice known only as The Teacher.With a pedigree such as the most popular book in the world, two Academy Award winners (Hanks, Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman), French film superstars (Tautou and Reno) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen), you'd wonder how such a film could fail.Well, how about the miscast of Howard as director. Howard lacks the vision to properly adapt the novel and bring it to life. Some of the blame does go to his Cinderella Man scribe Akiva Goldsman for not writing a fitting script. But Howard's awkwardness is more prominent. If we were going to pick name directors for this film, Steven Spielberg would have been better choice, but I think David Fincher (Se7en and Fight Club) would have been perfect.The whole production felt rushed. Having just read the book, a lot of plot points were fresh in my mind, and that may have clouded the comprehension of certain things, which I think Howard and Goldsman were counting on. Looking back on it, the first 30-45 minutes were very rushed, and I don't think things were adequately explained. They were still referenced and used in the movie, but not explained well. It suffered from the, what I call, Godfather syndrome: referencing things from the book at the wrong time. They could have taken their time with the film, and it would have told the same story, and been a lot better.Hanks was out of place as Landon, our hero. He doesn't have or project the same presence about him that Langdon should have. Might I suggest seasoned conspiracy theory veteran David Duchovny? As with Mission:Impossible:III, the supporting cast was impeccably put together, and the one true weakness of the cast is unfortunately the keystone (maybe it's just a bad year for actors named Tom).Slightly better than your average summer fair, but still doesn't hold up when put against the equally action oriented yet wholly more insightful X-Men franchise.",3
Vinci Da,"So I suggest not writing this off as a Hollywood hack film, simply because it's the bandwagon thing to do. Before you go and see The Da Vinci Code, let all the negative and positive hype surrounding this production cancel each other out, clear your mind, and judge this film fairly. Do NOT judge it on its usually weak director, do NOT judge it entirely on the source material and do NOT judge it on your religious beliefs. All this will be rewarding.I have not read the book so I will not attempt any kind of comparison. Plot essentially goes like this: In the middle of the night, Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned as an expert to a crime scene in Le Louvre where a terrible murder has been committed. The victim's body is self-placed in such a bizarre, symbolic way next to one of the world's most famous paintings that the investigation gradually unlocks age-old mysteries that many do not wish to be unlocked.The Da Vinci Code is a chilling, thrilling and well-sewn together mystery thriller that often keeps you on the edge of your seat. The cast do not disappoint either. Paul Bettany is genuinely creepy as Silas and thereby reinforces the stereotype that all albinos are evil. While Audrey Tatou is annoyingly frail as Sophie Neveu, she is captivating and lovely and is able to project both charisma and presence on screen in this film. However, Tom Hanks did not at all feel like the protagonist in the story and I am unaware whether that was intentional or not but I'm guessing no, in which case Hanks definitely fails in both attracting and keeping our interest.So the cast usually perform well (with the exception of Hanks) and the story is also facilitated by some very striking visuals. A big plus for this film which elevates it slightly above generic formula is its beautiful locations often seen through epic aerial shots. Good call, Howard! Another big plus is its distinctly Euro-centric feel in both style and substance. This surprised me since it is Tom Hanks and Ron Howard in the same film, but they do manage to keep the overblown Hollywood clichs to a minimum. This is even apparent in the score by Hans Zimmer; it is not overblown, but subtle and appropriate in the scenes to which it was scored. Similarly, Frenchmen do not speak English with a French accent when they were alone together, but speak in French. That said, the plot does unfold in a somewhat Hollywood fashion -- and the plot happens to be thinner than an Olsen twin.To counter the good parts, two big minuses in The Da Vinci Code are its wooden and sometimes even placeholder dialogue and its distinct lack of humor. I felt the actors were much too serious for this kind of film, which is first and foremost an adventure story, fast-paced and constantly unlocking new mysteries. The issues in the film were serious enough and needed more comedy to balance them.As I write this review, more and more bad points about it spring to mind. This is strange, since I remember sitting in the cinema with my friends just a few hours ago and being thoroughly entertained and captivated by the whole thing. So, never mind the occasionally insultingly far-fetched plot and plot-twists by Dan Brown; The Da Vinci Code is a nicely done and very entertaining film in which nothing feels missing or incomplete.7/10",4
Vinci Da,"I just watched the film, and even though I liked it, I must confess, I too expected more. I can't precisely point out what was missing and what I was expecting, but some it has some details that weren't there, some small imprecisions, some little things could have been better.Nevertheless, a pleasant movie to watch. I confess I need to see it again, since I saw it from 3 to 6 am, with very few hours of sleep on the night before. I suggest the ones who read the book to re-read it before they go see it - to add a little bit more perspective. To those who haven't, I wish you a lovely time at the movies - it really is pleasant to see.Praise to Audrey Tautou, a beautiful splendid actress, and all the other actors that don't need any more praise, like Ian McKellen, Jean Reno and Tom Hanks, who I didn't see fit the part at first, but who grew on me half-way through the movie, if not sooner. A huge praise to Paul Bettany too, for his astonishing and disturbing performance as Silas.I give it an 8, because it's one of the first movies made from books that did not make me go 'Oh, this was not like this in the book' every five seconds. I never saw Ron Howard as the ideal director for this movie - but he pulled it off decently, though a bolder choice would have been in order.",4
Vinci Da,"Firstly, this is only the second review I've ever posted on IMDb so am unsure as to what constitutes a spoiler to you guys so have checked the box just to cover myself. To be honest though, the whole film is a spoiler so just don't bother.I can't begin to write here how appalled I was that such a hyped and eagerly anticipated (not by me I must hasten to add) film could be so bad.I wasn't one of the 'trillions' that read Dan Brown's book, and I think the film makers just assumed that everyone in the audience had read the book, and more to the point, loved the book; ""so hey, we don't have to worry too much, whatever we do we're gonna make shed loads, just get it done!"". I deteste these films which come out of Hollywood, which seemingly are made purely for profit and let all the important attributes needed to make a true, decent film, fall to the way-side.It literally took about 15 minutes for me to decide that this film was a complete piece of crap. The dialogue used to move the plot along was ridiculous. In those first 15 minutes Tom Hanks (whom to my mind has only ever made a handful of decent movies at best) is giving a lecture to students. Then he gets taken aside to be told his friend was murdered, can he please come have a look. OK, strange but lets go with it. Then a french policeman tells him he must help immediately and it wouldn't be wise not to. Then a girl appears from nowhere and tells him he must come with her as the policeman is trying to kill him. Oh but wait, we can't go out the front door or anything, we have to go this way. Oh and by the way can you read codes by any chance? Oh you can? Wonderful! Then please de-code this before we go, it'll help greatly........And so the plot goes on and on and on like this, no explanation, no reasoning just blind commands that he follows again and again from anybody that cares to give him one. At no point in this opening 15 minutes does Tom Hanks question what people are telling him, he just believes them, does what he is told and moves onto the next stage. It was like watching a computer game, with the main character being told do this, do that, don't go here and quick come this way, by supporting characters just to progress onto the next level. It was mind-numbingly boring. Does no-one else agree even slightly with this? The strange thing is I briefly started to read the opening chapter or two of the book whilst I was away last month with my girlfriend, and my first impressions were that it read like a movie script so something doesn't quite add up........",1
Vinci Da,"By the halfway point, I had this film in my liked column, but then it just went on and on and on, in fact, even though I have left the theater, I still think the film is running. This is a thriller with no thrills, an intellectual mystery with no mystery or intellect. It posits a mystery 2000 years old and feels like it was filmed in real time. Who is Robert Langdon, the hero played by Tom Hanks? I get no feeling for anything about the guy, his claustrophobia is presented as being important, but it is an uninteresting embellishment and is clearly not important to the story.The whole story for the film reduces to. . .well, I don't know what it reduces to? I seemed to just be watching pretentious people running around on fool's errands. This is not always a problem in a movie, no one can adequately explain The Big Sleep and I defy anyone to clearly tell me what happens in the recent Russian film Night Watch, but those films have a surfeit of characters that make the twists and turns interesting to follow. Not to mention a wonderful visual strategy that makes them breath. The Da Vinci Code is a suffocating film that does the impossible; it makes the Louvre look boring.I was puzzled by the casting. With all American Tom Hanks on board and the French Audrey Tautou, the German Jurgen Prochnow and the competent Brits: Alfred Molina, Paul Bettany, and Ian McKellen, we have a Chinese dinner approach to casting ""one from column A and one from column B"", but this cast doesn't gel. They each do their little bits, but the whole does not add up to more than the parts. There were too many little things that rankled me or anyone with half a brain. The Louvre is filmed so blandly, that it doesn't really matter that they really used the real place for a location. Also, the Louvre does not have steel gates that come down when a painting is removed from the wall. Also, Tautou introduces herself as a ""French Police Cryptologist"". French Police Cryptologist? The French have a national police? The Louvre wouldn't be in the Paris police jurisdiction? Does your city have a staff cryptologist on its police force? Too many ludicrous things happen that made me ask questions while it is happening, not after it's all done when you would get the Hitchcock ""refrigerator moment"". I can take religious hooey, but I can't take scientific hooey. Even the car chases are uninteresting, and badly filmed.One more thing, if I am ever shot and have to leave a clue to the identity of my killer, I will write that he was an albino monk in a cassock with a cell phone and an automatic. There can't be that many running around, even in Paris.",1
Vinci Da,"So much for the ""sacred feminine""!This movie bore more resemblance to Paris Hilton than Paris, France. It was good looking, but extremely shallow.Ron Howard did a fine job of directing, but Tom Hanks was completely unconvincing. Visuals were excellent, but the music was overbearing. Ian McKellan was fabulous. The actors who played Fache and the bishop were also excellent, but did not have enough camera time. Too bad.Most of my criticisms are probably aimed at the material Howard had to work with, meaning the book, ""The DaVinci Code"", which contained multiple gross art history errors. As a veteran Art Teacher with a Master's degree in Art Education, these errors was extremely distracting to me in both reading the book and watching the movie.Some of these errors are as follows: The windows at the pyramid at the Louvre contain 673 panes of glass, not 666.Leonardo (Whose last name is NOT DaVinci..Da Vinci simply refers to the town he lived in) never referred to the ""Mona Lisa"" as the ""Mona Lisa"" in his life time. The moniker was given to the painting by the Art biographer Vasari in the 1800's; thus, Leonardo never could have come up with the outlandish anagrams.The painting ""Madonna on the Rocks"" is actually entitled ""Virgin on the Rock""; again, this was done so that Brown can create a convenient anagram. In the Louvre, it is NOT located in the same room as the Mona Lisa.The Last Supper is NOT a fresco. It is a mural. If Mary Magdeline is to the left of Christ in the painting, then where was John? Why would Leonardo make him be missing? It was customary for painters from the Florentine school (where Leonardo hailed from), to make young men appear more feminine than older men, to infuse a bit of innocence in their appearance. Additionally, the Bible contains NO references to the ""holy grail"", or ""chalice"". Leonardo was simply making his painting more natural,in keeping with his naturalistic interpretations of his subjects.That's what Leonardo was famous for!! Leonardo, like most of us, simply believed that Jesus didn't have the, uh, "" bling"" to own a golden chalice!!There is a sketch by Leonardo of the ""mystery hand"" holding the knife in the Royal Windsor Art collection, and that hand definitely belongs to Peter. It is not a ""disembodied hand wielding a dagger"".If I hadn't read the book first, I would have been confused with the flash backs, which were very poorly rendered.The film was very ""talky"", which is bad enough, but the talk itself wasn't accurate. I'm surprised the main female character's (Sophie) head didn't explode with all the condescending lectures she was given.""Sacred feminine"", indeed...I'm a woman, and ""The Davinci Code"" insulted my intelligence.",1
Vinci Da,"Screened overnight for Australian media.Four words - wrong star, wrong director.Hanks and Howards best work, both together or separately, have been when they embrace intrinsically American values in their films. All their most memorable movies have involved individuals overcoming hardship through an unshakable belief in love and courage, usually set against an outwardly US-centric interpretation of events. Think Apollo 13, Forrest Gump, Cinderella Man, Saving Private Ryan - all fine films, all centred on an American hero rising above their circumstance.What is conspicuously absent from either man's resume is a European-set, religious-themed mystery thriller. Having sat through their arduous, laborious adaptation of Dan Brown's novel, I can now see why.The plot is total bunkum - a hodgepodge of ""what ifs"" and ""oh my god"" moments spun on the ludicrous premise that Leonardo Da Vinci had some sort of insight into the life of Christ - but loopy story lines have not stopped many films from being enjoyable.What makes The Da Vinci Code so deathly dull is the heavy-handed, oh-so-serious approach Howard applies to the material. Combining with his cinematographer to give the film a sleepy nocturnal feel (not so clever given the 150min running time), Howard's film is just a constant flow of expository clues that fail to create any tension or engender his leads with any human qualities. Even for those that haven't read the book, a couple of obligatory 'big twists' in the story are very obvious from early-on.Hanks (looking more like Jim Belushi than ever) and McKellen blather on and on and on about knights and saints and symbols and God as if they were giving a lecture at some Ivy-league school for the supernatural; Audrey Tautou is lovely but has little to do in a role that is plot- not character-driven. Jean Reno ambles thru another of his token French cop parts (he was better in the Pink Panther); Paul Bettany's evil albino Silas at least got some audience reaction, though giggles and guffaws were probably not what he was hoping for.Whatever sense of fun and excitement the book provided is fully-drained from this adaptation. Come credit time, I had the realisation that all this hokey, airport-novel religious hooey and B-movie plotting would've made for a great X-files episode in that series heyday. As the end-product of a publishing phenomenon and carrying the tag ""Years Most-Anticipated"", its a boring dud.",0
Vinci Da,"Playing Sir Leigh Teabing, the great British actor, Sir Ian McKellen, does not disappoint as he delivers the legend of ""The Da Vinci Code."" The theory that is known as 'the Da Vinci code' is what Sir Leigh Teabing teaches to the would-be living descendant of Jesus of Nazareth.Howard's direction is a marvel. Hanks, whose films I usually don't like in the least, plays the only character he's taken that I became enthralled by, Dr. Robert Langdon, and Audrey Tautou as French Agent Sophie Neveu is certainly a gorgeous, fresh face in a major US film who aptly held a captivating leading role.Though I can certainly understand why ""The Da Vinci Code,"" is so controversial in US society, because the theory of there being a child conceived by Jesus and Mary Magdelene is not what the Roman Catholic Church wants to believe or witness even being publicly proposed. The very idea of the God-man being so human as to be married somehow threatens ""the Church,"" and its dogma. Strange how it fortifies and invigorates my own (Christian) spirituality! Regardless, this movie is one of my favorites! My rationale for finding favor in it has nothing to do with religion. I have found it fascinating and riveting because it is one heck of an intriguing story that was expertly directed, acted, and filmed. The excitement was ever so understandable within the film itself. The characters of the Opus Dei group made the motion picture's tension build like a very well written suspense as they scrambled for what Teabing wound up with.Though I am reticent to admit it, Hanks and Tautou made for quite a good screen match. Though their performances are excellent, they can't touch their elder British screen pro, Sir Ian McKellen's. I'm now convinced more than ever that McKellen has been the most versatile actor of our time: From the most watched children's series ""X-Men"" as comic book/sci-fi's evil ""Magneto;"" to numerous Shakespearean characters, such as King ""Richard III,"" ""Iago,"" & ""Edward II;"" to one of the best Hitlers ever in ""Countdown to War;"" to a Nazi war criminal cornered by a high school kid in, ""Apt Pupil;"" to the good wizard ""Gandalf,"" in the highly acclaimed, ""Lord of the Rings,"" trilogy; to the gay film director of ""Frankenstein,"" James Whale, in the biopic that was utterly overlooked at the Oscars, ""Gods and Monsters;"" I know whenever I spend my time with a motion picture that McKellen plays in, I'm in for the best script & performance that an actor of his acumen and towering stature would pick.So it is no surprise to me that the character of Sir Leigh Teabing is the one who recants the story of the 'Da Vinci code' and does so as a historian who is an expert in the study of it.I also liked the fact that this movie does come to a convincing end. Not one that convinces me of the Da Vinci code theory, necessarily, but an ending that leaves the characters themselves with open questions. There's no room for a sequel. Yet, the movie is so well done it leaves me wanting more.It's not that this motion picture is a classic, by any means. But rather, that it is a terrific story, with a great deal of suspense, action, intrigue, and at times more than a little horrific and scary.Most of all, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is now and will continue to be legendary.",0

Vinci Da,"The first five minutes, when I'm supposed to believe that an old man, after being shot in the stomach, strips himself naked, draws a circle on the floor and a star on his chest in his own blood, writes a message in code (also in his own blood) that leads to a painting with another coded message that leads to another painting with yet another coded message, several of which are written in invisible ink (he just happened to have a bottle on him when he was shot?). Then he lays down in the circle and dies in the pose of the Vitruvian Man. I'm surprised he didn't also pause to make a sandwich and finish that novel he'd been working on.Monty Python could have done a better job with this movie.",2

Tom Hanks, Professor of Silly Nonsense at Harry Potter university doesn't make a move on Audrey Tatou. Some stuff happens and they're in a van. Ian McKellen can afford a villa in Portugal by hamming it up egregiously.Apparently this film and book offended some peoples imaginary friend.I can see why, such a waste of money when people are going hungry.Raspberries all around.",1
Vinci Da,"Dan Brown's international bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" has enjoyed phenomenal success because it taps into a wellspring of so many different and fascinating topics. The novel touches upon the early history of Christianity, the mysteries of the medieval Knights Templar society, numerology, and, above all, the archetype of the Grail Quest. The strength of Ron Howard's film lies in its integrity of striving to be faithful to Dan Brown's novel. The fidelity is apparent in each of the following areas:SCREENPLAY: Akiva Goldsman's script includes nearly all of the major scenes from the novel. To his credit, Goldsman provides dialogue on the Knights Templar, Mary Magdelene, Leonardo's ""Last Supper"" mural and other details from the novel. DIRECTION: Ron Howard's stylish approach to the film includes interesting camera angles, especially in the aerial shots of such great location sites as the Louvre in the Paris and the Rosslyn chapel in Scotland. It was clear that Howard wanted not merely an action picture, but a leisurely paced retelling of Dan Brown's story. There was also the thoughtful use of close-ups in the more intimate moments with a brilliant analytical scene dissecting the controversial ""chalice"" apparent in Leonardo's ""Last Supper.""CINEMATOGRAPHY: Overall, the film was appropriately dark and moody. The flashback sequences were shot in a grainy style that contrasted with the action-packed story of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. Salvatore Totino deserves the highest praise for his tasteful yet imaginative camera work.ACTING: Tom Hanks was not overly charismatic as Robert Langdon. But that is precisely the bookish Everyman who is the protagonist of Dan Brown's novel. As Sophie, Audrey Tatou was more dynamic than Robert, as appropriate to her character as well; there was a sparking and even radiant quality to this young performer. The supporting cast was solid with Jean Reno especially successful in developing multiple layers of characterization in the morally conflicted detective Bezu Fache. Perhaps most memorably, Ian McKellen delivers a star turn as the scholar Leigh Teabing.Over twenty years ago, Umberto Eco's novel ""The Name of the Rose"" was the equivalent in its time of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code."" The subsequent film version of Eco's story was a disappointment in its attempt to equal the success of the novel version of ""The Name of the Rose."" In the case of Ron Howard's film version of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" however, not only does the film do justice to the novel, but in many respects it is better!",0
Vinci Da,"When I heard that they were bringing out a movie of the best selling book I decided I would see the movie first as I always enjoy books more and didn't want to be disappointed. It's not easy for a film to grip an audience and I thought Ron Howard did an excellent job with his film. It's quite a long movie and every time I thought it was going to end something else happened.Ian McKellen was fabulous in this film and stole the majority of the scenes he was in delivering some excellent one-liners along the way. I loved his passion for England and was very pleased to see he hasn't lost his talent. Paul Bettany was also tremendous in this film and it made me see him in a different light. After Wimbledon I wasn't sure of his acting skills but The Da Vinci Code proved him worthy of many of the actors in Hollywood today.Tom Hanks is one of my all-time favourite actors but I have to say he just didn't seem comfortable in the role of Robert Langdon. He wasn't terrible but he just didn't come up to par with some of his previous roles which I felt was a shame. Audrey Tatou was very good in her role and I couldn't have imagined a better actress for the role.Overall I felt the film was great, even with Ron Howard's inevitable cheesy scene...'Godspeed' from Tom Hanks. After seeing the film I decided to read the book and I can see why some people prefer the book. However I think it is much harder for a film to grip then it is a book and so for that reason I gave The Da Vinci Code 9/10. I would say anyone should go and see it, just accept it as a film, not as an adaptation of a book.",5
Vinci Da,"This is a review from a person that has NOT read the book. The critics were never more polarized: some said it was the best film ever and some said it was a horrible film. The most disturbing part was that most of these critics uttered these claims without ever having seen the film. Even the ""journalists"" who saw the first show in Cannes were negative in a way that was almost unheard of. In fact, I have read so many negative reviews (too long, too narrative, boring, predictable, laughable, Tom Hanks ashamed, Ron Howard ashamed, public not amused. etc.) that I was almost tempted not to collect my 2 premiere tickets to the nearby cinema, saving me 20 euro's in the process. My companion (who did read the book, by the way) however insisted and we went. Good, so now I can write about it first hand. Yes, it's a long time to sit with your face directed upwards to the big screen (two and a half hours, plus 15 minutes commercials). Granted, and it contains lots of talking and here and there, some plot movements were indeed incredible and it was quite predictable in certain parts (remember, I did NOT read the book nor did I know the plot), but in whole, it was a fascinating film indeed. Of course, it was a fascinating novel to begin with and personally I found the direction of the film, as well as the parts of most notably Tatou, McKellen and Reno, excellent. I am well aware that, although some points are right on, a considerable part of the story is fiction and some of the facts in the film are dead wrong (unambiguously and easily ascertainable), but most stories, if not all, are. Nothing special about that. Why do many people find exactly this story bad? Simply because of the fact that it is believed to undermine these same people's religious beliefs. But religion itself is based on beliefs, and never the whole truth. This lies within the fundamental definition of what we call religion. Myths are not seldom more true. But that is all irrelevant. Religion itself brings that people will always bend the truth or intermix truth with facts, even facts which are out of place, out of time, or both. Nothing new or spectacular about that. What is spectacular, that this is possibly the most interesting time in recent history in a way that many people start to rethink the whole Christian beliefs. And the fact that the Judas gospel was published also this year, helped tremendously in the process. That process of rethinking belief, that alone is valuable. Many critics wrote from this belief: if you are a fundamentalist Christian, you will most likely hate Brown's book, the film and its message. And if you hate the church, chances are that you love it (I can't think of another reason why over half (616) of the 1176 voters to this instant I write this review, valued this film with a 10 out of 10 (no film in history is worth this)). But both opinions don't count for much, if you ask me, because they are prejudiced ans biased and nothing good ever came from those sentiments. And I can really do without critics who claim you go to hell if you go out and see the film. Hey buddy, I know about hell, I live in The Netherlands... -spoilers after this- Was the a historic person called Jesus the Christ? Probably, but not certainly. Was Jesus the Christ married with Maria Magdalena? Possibly. If yes, did they have children? Possibly. And is Maria Magdalena buried under the Louvre? Unlikely. And is Tatou a direct descendant of Maria Magdalena and Jesus? Very unlikely. Did the Catholic church try to hide Christ's bloodline? I don't think so. Does the church know much more than they say? Certainly. Did the church commit genocide over and over for unholy reasons? Absolutely. Is the new testament complete? Most certainly not - even the translations contain dreadful mistakes. Were there indeed more than 100 gospels instead of 4? Very likely. Is half of Dan Brown's book fantasy? Most likely, yes, but also half is most likely true. but that is again not the issue here. The issue is that if you do have a sufficiently long attention span, if you do have an open mind and if you do have more than half a brain, you may very well enjoy this film. And never stop thinking, no matter who informs you: The Priest, The Politician, The Legislator, The Judge, The Scientist, The Teacher, The Novelist, Mr Gates or the critic. Just never stop thinking...",4
Vinci Da,"OK, I read the book like everyone else and loved it! I had the pleasure (or so I thought) of going to see a staff screening of the film with my friend this morning and I had to say I was very very very disappointed! I know films are never as good as the books they are based on but this just wound me up the wrong way completely. I never felt like there was much ""code breaking"" or deep thought involved by any of the characters and It annoyed me the way that things were illuminated as Tom hanks concentrated on them. It felt like it was for idiots to identify where he came up with his conclusions. The acting was very good in regards to all characters but I did feel that Jean Reno was underused and Paul Bettany as Silas wasn't as great as the media have lead us to believe. Sure the monk was misguided but it didn't feel like he really cared that much about finding the keystone/grail...whatever. I felt that everything in the movie was a bit rushed, and the differences in the story from that of the book, just didn't feel right. It kinda went off on a tangent at the end and I felt like a lot of questions went unanswered. The grail guardians also didn't look like they'd stand up to much with the majority of them a few years short of zimmer frames. Overall I'd give this movie 4 out of 10 and it annoys me greatly that It's going to make millions riding on the popularity of the book. If this was an unknown film with another name It would be quickly forgotten.",2
Vinci Da,"I haven't read the book. I am neutral towards religion. The DaVinci Code is the Worst Movie I have seen this year. I never felt at any point in the story that I cared for these characters. That I wanted them to find the ""Holy Grail."" I felt no suspense or thrill in this movie. I felt more interested in ""DaVinci Decoded"" on the History channel than this POS. When something is this awful, all i can say is Ron Howard, learn your craft please. MI-III was not the best script, but the movie was amazing technically and Tom Cruise's performance was top notch. Ron Howard, please pay attention, this is not 1970's- learn some new things please. Learn how to use the green screen, or to move the camera. Please god, someone teach this man some craft. Technology and Film-making has evolved, please learn. I feel so awful right now after watching this movie. Where the f**k is the suspense and the thrill of the movie. I haven't seen RV, but thats probably got more excitement than this piece of junk.",1
Vinci Da,"What a load of pretentious, pompous nonsense this flick is.Dear oh dear......absolute rubbish.The movie begins with someone being murdered in a French museum, and there then follows a unbearably tedious 'detective' trail with people having murderous intent and the hypothesis is Jesus had a wife, children and there exists a present day blood line blah, blah, blah.... Yawn....Without exception every actor/actress given ridiculously hammy and unconvincing performances.But every one of them seems convinced of their own self importance. Yawn.....The movie goes on for over two hours, but it seems like two years, and I fell asleep in it several times. Yawn.....If u can't get to sleep watch this as you will be slumbering within minutes:1/10",1
Luka Chuppi,"The movie starts with a statement from a superstar that he is living in a live-in relationship, the opposition of which is then taken up by right-wing political parties as their election motto, and this same topic pops up in almost every second conversation in the film, no matter what the original dialogue is about. This makes the whole movie feel like a heavily scripted low class drama. The only thing that's keeping it afloat is a good performance by the actress. Karthik Aryan, on the other hand, fails to impress with his sad, always dejected but suddenly excited character, as he did with his previous films. What really sinks this film for me, however, is the forced humor spread throughout the movie which might appeal to the mass audience but actually has very little weight in terms of real comedy. All in all, a film to skip, in my opinion. It's only two hours, but feels like much more, especially when you are sitting in there wondering what people around you are laughing and cheering about.",2
Luka Chuppi,Movie is senseless. It's one time watch but not for everyone.,2
Luka Chuppi,This movie lacks in story and direction. They were just dragging the live in relationship subject and doing nonsense things. Only good thing in this movie is acting of Pankaj Tripathi and Chote Miyan acting,1
Luka Chuppi,"Be warned ! Don't have high expectation from this type of film. This is a normal family drama with very much Predictable plot that you will feel why it is happening like this when it can be sorted in numerous ways (if u were in the shoes of guddu also) this was the first film of Kartik that i didn't able to enjoy only Pankaj Tripathi performance was good. At one pointy of the film you will feel why they are stretching this short story to a long version.
OkaY I understand that the theme of the film is somewhat Unique not like a typical bollywood movie but it can be presented in a very Beautiful way also which Director failed to execute.
Many times we the MOVIEGOERS watch a film that have a good story line and good execution if this both thing is not equally maintain then we get upset. And in the case of Lukka Chuppi neither of them was executed well.
May this film was not my cup of tea and maybe i was too harsh but HONESTLY it was the true words from my perspective ....",2
Luka Chuppi,"Luka Chuppi is a tiresome tale of a couple from Mathura, Guddu and Rashmi, who decide to experiment with a live-in relationship. They do this by pretending to be married. And all that can go wrong does.The writing by Rohan Shankar is consistently feeble. Scenes are stretched endlessly and the humour is limp. The comic flourishes are underlined by annoyingly loud background music, which cues us to laugh but so little of Luka Chuppi is actually funny.Lukka Chuppi features five remixes which is a sign of the larger issue with the film - there just isn't enough freshness or flair here.Luka Chuppi isn't without its moments, but its downside overwhelms its strengths by a big margin. It offers shallow entertainment at best. Watch the film only if that is good enough for you.Laxman Utekar's Luka Chuppi explores the concept of live-in relationships in small-town Mathura and Gwalior, where they are heavily frowned upon. However, despite having top-notch performances and hilarious moments, the film leaves much to be desired as it only manages to scratch the surface.But what really makes 'Luka Chuppi' an entertaining watch is the nuanced writing by Rohan Ghoge and its execution. The first half is swift and packed with funny moments that end in an unpredictable twist. The second half too, is marked by quite a few laugh-out-loud moments.Overall, 'Luka Chuppi' is a fun ride that never gets too preachy or uncomfortable for the family audience. It's a clean entertainer with a message that's not too loud, but clear, for sure.Rohan Shankar's story is novel and entertaining and different from other such films in this genre. The characters are very well fleshed out and most importantly, they are relatable. Rohan Shankar's screenplay is effective for most parts and evokes the right humour. At some places however, it is a bit weak, especially in the first half.On the whole, LUKA CHUPPI is a funny take on the modern relationships laced with dollops of situational and funny moments. This clean comedy would get thumbs up not just from the youngsters but also from the family audiences. Recommended!Be warned, 'Luka Chuppi' isn't a life-altering romantic comedy which sets out to make some grave social comment. It's a light-hearted film - with a scattered, almost fickle, storyline - bolstered by good performances from a sturdy cast. While you may not put a ring on this one, you can definitely live with it for a couple of hours of your life.",2
Luka Chuppi,"LUKA CHUPPI REVIEW -
Luka Chupi wasn't looking convincing from the trailer itself, that actually helped to keep the expectations lower and not to feel much disappointed. A desi Film with Simple story and Light Comedy is always welcome but what if an Ordinary Script goes even more ordinary and then Light moments goes in vain because of unnecessary fiasco created in the screenplay? Not Good, huhhh. That's what Luka Chuppi is.From the Trailer we got an idea that the Film tells the story of Live In Relationship and Marriage fiasco in Funny style, but in film there are some more factors like Politics, Emotions and Youth Generation thinking in addition. The basic conviction goes wrong here that what exactly
Director wanted to say? Was he confused while focusing on multiple subjects in one script? It seems that, he was. Making sense is always important, no matter if you are telling big story or small one and that doesn't happen here. Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon shows Good Chemistry on screen, the supporting cast is good too. Pankaj Tripathi is a Show stealer who brings Gauranteed Laughters whenever he is present on screen. Music is a Plus point but all are recreations therefore credit goes to the originals. Screenplay has many goofs, writing includes unnecessary elements, Dialogues are decent. Direction is Immature and confused which could have been much much better. The vision was Overgeneral.As a whole, Luka Chuppi is a Below Average film, apart from some real, genuine Laughters there is nothing more in the dish. That USP thing is missing which gives an Identity to any film. Hit songs and Startcast might help but still Box Office Success of the Film is doubtful. A better director with better vision and this one would have been a Good Light Hearted Comedy, but for now it is less for sure.RATING- 4/10*",2
Luka Chuppi,Immature directions and childish play. Waste of time. No humor timing nor any captive scene. Bogus repetitive plot. Not expected from the good cast to sign up for this one.,1
Luka Chuppi,"Luka Chuppi stars Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon in the lead with Pankaj Tripathi, Vinay Pathak, Aparshakti Khurana and others.fans have been buzzing about the scintillating on-screen chemistry between Kartik and Kriti. The songs too, especially the remake of '90's song - Poster Lagwa Do, has become a fan favourite.The humour element in the film lands on point every now and then. And the best part, the humour is more situational than slapstick.Luka Chuppi explores the story of a young couple who wanted to try being in a 'live-in relationship' before getting married.what really makes 'Luka Chuppi' an entertaining watch is the nuanced writing by Rohan Ghoge and its execution. The first half is swift and packed with funny moments that end in an unpredictable twist. The second half too, is marked by quite a few laugh-out-loud moments. At some point, the humour becomes repetitive, but it's the short run-time that comes to the film's rescue. Film's two most popular songs (Coca-Cola & Poster) are thrown in at the end, during the credit roll.Overall, 'Luka Chuppi' is a fun ride that never gets too preachy or uncomfortable for the family audience. It's a clean entertainer with a message that's not too loud, but clear, for sure.",3
Luka Chuppi,I admit that there was I hype for this movie especially after Aaryan's fame in Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety and even I had my some level of excitement for this. But the movie was too chaotic and the story wasn't stable and the characters were feeling pretty messed up in themselves. The only bit positive thing in the whole drama was the songs (even they all were remake) that to some extent lit the mood. I am not sure even if this is a One Time Watch but have it your money spent on this hyped but disappointing Rom-Com..,2
Luka Chuppi,"This movie make you sit first to last with a laugh-ting riot and situational humor. The concept that is 'live-in relationship' is very relatable to new generation. This film does not show live-in but it shows how a boy and girl wants to get this type of relation,than they have lots of problem. Basically it is not very common in india. Family does not accept this type of relationships, than how couple face this problem and the film shows it situation wise very humorously. Execution was good and the acting is very commendable. Cinematography was too good. The film actually very entertaining. So very worth watching movie to get humongous entertainment.",5
Luka Chuppi,REALLY LAUGHED A LOT. A NICE MESSAGE AT THE END! Sweet romantic funny and heart warming!,5
Luka Chuppi,Garbage movie...plz dont go plz plz...if u r going coz of karthik aaryan then plz dont...its worst movie of kartik aaryan,2
Luka Chuppi,"This movie is total crap story,screenplays are bad and and it becomes hard for you to watch full movie...:-(",1
Luka Chuppi,"Absolutely no chemistry between these two. That female should be banned.
I expected much more from the lead actor but he cannot act at all.
After seeing the genuineness of badhai ho, this is absolutely horrendous.
Please save yourself and don't waste your time. I am writing this as the female lead is trying her best to act, in the theater. Oh man please stop it!",1
Luka Chuppi,If these are your favourite acotor or actress then watch it (for peace of your mind )otherwise movie story has nothing . I have watched movie and needed to skip some scene boring . I watched bcz she is my favourite ^_^,1

The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"I hate how people in horror movies do dumb stuff. Like go upstairs instead of trying to use the back door and making it outside. The characters do the same thing here specifically the kids. It's frustrating on how bad the writing was. Like why would you do that? It has so much potential. Cinematography and production really stand out for me. The pale colors and the set pieces I really enjoy. The story is as simple as it gets. CPS case worker goes to discover 2 children dead in a canal. She has to take her children with her, even though the boy is old enough to babysit. Then the boy goes on an adventure and wants to be nosy. Then he encounters The vengeful spirit La Llarona and gets his sister and mother cursed. Then the mom looks for help to stop her from taking her children. I swear I've seen this before. The Jump scares still kind of get you, even though you see them coming. It's the same old, same old. Im very worried for the conjuring 3 now. I hope they get new writers.",3
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"This was boring and predictable.
The ghost was shown too much.
The set pieces felt repetitive.
The main characters didn't go on any kind of transformation/arc.
Please don't make another movie this tired New Line/Atomic. Please!",0
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"I like to scare myself and The Curse of La Llorona is the scary fun. Since then, I no longer dare to go to the cellar alone.",5
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"All the clichs of the genre, the weeping woman turns quickly and it breaks bones, that even shows up in the trailer when the child sees her, jump cheap scares and all the same old things that people of today like, like for example everything is silent, suddenly a loud sound and she appears behind you in the shadows. TOTALLY PREDICTABLE. When the girl looks out the door I already knew it was for her doll and voila, that was it. Everything is fortuitous. The stupid shaman that is trying to be funny, the kids behaving so foolish that everyone in the room wanted to punch them, people laughed and they were angry (but that's the script's fault). The other mexican crazy lady that becomes bad and vindictive in order to finish the others, and in the end is redeemed from one moment to another because the plot says. This movie is like a Mexican fast food in the USA that you find in a corner, which is not the REAL FOOD in Mexico. It has good things and I know that there are people who like this kind of cheap fear, and there were some who got scared in the room and even shouted and covered their faces. SPOILER: In the end they kill La Llorona, that's like killing The Bogeyman, totally absurd, that's an urban legend in all Latin America, a folklore, a woman who lost her children and is walking around kidnapping others. You can't kill Baba Yaga.",3
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"Personally I was expecting this movie to be in the 6-8/10 range so it was a bit underwhelming for me. The film felt much longer than it was and looking at the clock after leaving and it was fairly short at around 90 minutes. I felt as though I was sitting there for about 2 hours and half of that time I was fairly bored. There were only perhaps one or two moments where I felt scared and even then it was only very mild and for a few seconds when a jump scare had occurred. It's worth noting that I am not familiar with the source material / urban legend so it's not a story that has any personal meaning to me. I found the setting of 1970s LA quite bland even though it shouldn't have been and the characters generally uninteresting including the monster. I don't mind the idea of the monster's origin story but it's still not really interesting enough to carry a whole film in my opinion, unless it was done really really well. I think had the film been set somewhere more isolated it would have helped a lot. There is not a whole lot to like about the film for me apart from a few decent scenes and the stereotypical horror film moments of stupidity are there for a few unintentional laughs along the way. I'd say the film is worth a watch for horror fans but I'm not sure it's really worth the price of entry so see if you can watch it another way at some point in the future.",3
After,"There were parts of this movie that were romantic and left everyone in the cinema feeling smitten. However, having read the books, I have a few bones to pick.The beginning was quite rushed so their relationship was not developed well. One second they meet each other and the next they are already at the lake ... and anyone who has seen the movie or read the book knows what happens at the lake; it was all too fast for me to truly feel happy and excited that they are finally getting together.The movie was oddly PG. Anyone who has read the books will know that the books are a lot more passionate. It is confusing as to why a story about college students is kept so PG when college students in general aren't PG. They adapted a very intimate and non-PG book into a PG movie, which many who read the book might be disappointed by, as I was.This is an oddly specific bone to pick, but: I felt the placement of the scene where they argue in class over Elizabeth Bennet came too soon. They are in essence arguing about Tessa being interested in Hardin, but by then that didn't seem like an issue. Perhaps this scene would have made more sense being after the lake and restaurant scene where she does confront him about whether he is embarrassed to be seen with her. But, what is done is done.Lastly, the movie did not portray the essence of the love-hate relationship in the book. Where was Hardin's jealousy and possessiveness? Where was Tessa's attitude towards Hardin? They tried to capture the complicated nature of Hardin's character when he tells the story of his drunken father and his mother whilst at his dad's wedding, but there was no development on this - I didn't see emphasis on the relationship issues he seemed to have in the book. Also, in the book I myself had a love-hate relationship with Hardin's character, but in the movie I simply just enjoyed looking at Hero Fiennes-Tiffin considering how good looking he is.All in all, it was still an enjoyable movie and I could tell a lot of hard work went into it. The movie was beautiful to watch, especially the lake scene and the bathtub scene (which was an especially cute scene). Casting was done well; Josephine Langford (Tessa) and Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (Hardin) we're extremely well suited to their characters, but I feel they could have done more with their characters if they were given the opportunity.The romantic scenes were cute and made me smile, but the movie lacked the deeper layer that the book has about how complicated people can be, and the message of learning to love someone despite their flaws as well as trying to be a better person for the one you love. Considering Ana Todd (the author of After) was on set all the time, I am confused as to why she allowed the movie to stray so far from the core messages of the book.Small details of the book were included and did leave a smile on my face when they came up as they reminded me of the effect the book initially had on me, but the bigger-picture messages and themes of the book seemed missing.Viewers who have not read the book may be confused by the fast pace, as I used a lot of my knowledge from the book to fill in gaps.Reading the book does cloud my judgement, so I would like to emphasize that it was still a good movie which I plan to rewatch many times.Should you watch this movie? Yes.Do I want a sequel? Yes; I am hoping much of what was left out in this movie was because they plan to make a sequel, one which is more passionate and explores the complicated nature of Hardin and Tessa. The movie did not have the same effect on me as the book did, but I would still watch it again and tell others to watch it.",4
After,"I may be bias because I read and loved the books but it was a great movie. Just like any indie movie just starting out, it has its flaws. I felt because I read the book I noticed how rushed it was and all the changes but it wasnt that bad. The chemistry is amazing, the actors were great and it brought me back to when I watched you drive me crazy, shes all that and cruel intentions. Definitely gave me that throwback vibe and cult classic.",5
After,"I loved the movie. Reading the books and being so in love with them I was SO excited for this movie. If you're a true fan of the book then you should seriously just be glad you even have actual characters played out in front of you! You could tell the story was there! There is still so much see and witness from the book and these actors. There is SO much more of the story we love to be told. The books as Tessa & Hardin were written in 2014.. to make it adapt to 2019 there were changes. GOOD changes. And adaptation of the book isn't making it exactly like the book itself, it's taking bits and pieces (important) pieces and making it into its own! I love the curve they took with the film & I would give anything for them to be able to make sequels! What does it hurt anyone to be supportive of something others are passionate about!? I'm proud & in love with this film! I'm angry about people just not being supportive!",5
After,"I personally loved this movie. It's beautifully shot and the actors have an amazing chemistry. I read the books back in 2014 and the author herself said that the movie is going to be different since you can't really fit a 400 pages book in 100 minutes. The changes that they made were necessary in my opinion and I prefer the ""softer"" Hardin from the movie. The movie has a great message and shouldn't be getting so much hate just because it's not exactly like the books. 10/10 from me. Hoping for a second one! People should watch it with an open mind.",5
After,"Coming from a person who has read the books from the start, the movie is amazing! For people who have read them all as well, I just want to say that it is best to walk into the theater with an open mind due to the fact that it is nearly impossible to fit an entire 600 pages into a film. Some things are changed from the novel and in my opinion I think it is for the best because I will admit...the book can be a little harsh for the big screen BUT 'After' is NOT romanticizing an abusive relationship. It is about two non-perfect people who find each other in the dark and bring light at the end. It's not a fairy tale story but it is a real one. A real life story that needs to be told considering the fact that there are people around the world who, more or less, have the same storyline as Tessa and Hardin. Personally speaking, I believe that everyone (read the books or not) will love this film! It's different from other romance movies and it is something new to people. It will leave the audience lost for words and wanting more for a sequel!!!",4
After,"After is the kind of film that could have gone horribly wrong. Well, it had all the ingredients - good girl, bad girls, brooding mysterious college hottie, wannabe college teens sporting nose piercings & tattoos, dysfunctional families & broken marriages..the list will go on. But what trumps all of this the heavyduty emotional texture of the film. The intense romance that develops between Tessa and Hardin in a conventional yet very mystical way. There are not many twists and the narrative is simple. However, it hoodwinks you into feeling that something really uncanny will happen - whether or not it does, is for you to find out. Makeout scenes are aplenty but none OTT. They are aesthetic and complimentary to the storytelling. Director Jenny Gage handles that well with his young, good looking actors keeping their next-door image intact. Audience will relate with their characters and root for both of them. Pace is slow but consistent with moments that will stay with you. Overall, AFTER is the kind of college romance everyone hopes for - it's got love, lust and heartbreak in equal measure!",4
After,"If you love high school romances with full of drama and love then you should watch After. I really loved the books but I didn't like the Hardin of the books instead I fell in love with the Hardin of the movie . Great cast with new faces , something fresh and romantic to see . It really reminds you your first love and I really hope for the sequels",5
After,Honestly I have been waiting for this movie for ages !! Since I love all the books so much! The movie was really interesting to me and I didn't feel board thoughout the whole thing. The movie and the book are very different to each other but still similar to each other in another way which was a nice new take on the story. The new scenes that were added in the movie were really cute and fun to watch too. I think both Hero and Joshpine did a great job in portraying Hardin and Tessa. Joshpine is really what I pictured Tessa to look and be like and her acting was enjoyable. Hero was amazing!! I loved his portrayal of Hardin Scoot I thought he did a fantastic job even though Hardin was a lot more softer in the movie than in the book which didn't really please me and a fan of the book but I felt it worked well with the story line of the movie. However even though I enjoyed the film sooooo much as a fan of the book I feel like some characters weren't played to their full potential in the movie my main concern was the absence of Zed's infatuation with Tessa which was very much present in the books but not in the film. The other characters also didn't get much screen time in the movie which was a shame as you couldn't see their true personalities but none the less I still enjoyed the film very much and I hope that there will be a sequel to the movie as there is a lot more to the story of Hardin and Tessa,5
After,"This movie is based off of the wattpad series by Anna Todd which was a great hit obviously. The book itself was incredibly addicting and so realistic and amazing. The movie did a wonderful job to create that feeling again and the cast and crew were just so amazing. The movie is about coming of age , boy meets girl . There's definitely more to it but I'll leave it for y'all to see. I loved every second of it and would watch it a billion more times , if you have not read the books definitely check them out. Praying for a sequel!!",5
After,"I think the movie captured the essence of the book. It's quite impossible to make it 100% true to the book. I liked the adaptions, they made sense considering the length of the movie. The cemestry between Hero and Josephine is amazing, they did a wonderful job. Hardin is a bit softer than in the book, but I don't mind that at all because it's perfect for the movie. Some things happens really fast, but again an adaption I can live with because it works for the movie. The ending is so sweet and beautiful and I hope for more After movies. Overall love the books love the movie I'm a happy Afternator.",5
After,"This is one film that will stop your daydreams of the ideals and give you a spank of reality. A good mix of laughter and pain, awesome performance of the casts, and the undeniable chemistry of the two leads. Salute to the director as well for the conscious efforts of feminist approach. Cinematography is excellent. This movie is one amazing experience. People need to detach themselves from the book and should see the beauty of the film on its own. Can't wait for the sequels.",5
After,"I think the movie captures the essence of the book beautifully. It's an adaptation so the changes were necessary, the end result came together perfectly.",5
After,"This movie was done beautifully and way better than I expected!!!! if you've read the book before it's best to keep an open mind because no movie will turn out exactly how it's told in it's novel. The cast and crew did an amazing job at telling Hardin and Tessa's love story, yes of course there could've been some minor changes but overall the movie was amazing and after waiting five years for my favorite novel to be made into a movie, it truly did not disappoint!!! Truly am hoping for a second movie so their story can be told in more detail !",5
After,After is based of the wattpad series by Anna Todd. The series itself were so incredibly addictive. The movie was just as good ! I loved every second of it & enjoyed the casting do such an amazing job to portray Anna Todd's book. This movie will have you at the edge of your seat with all squeals !! My favorite movie of all time now for sure. Hopefully we get a sequel. If you haven't read the books definitely do so !! It's totally worth it .,5
After,"This movie was GREAT! I am typically scared when my fave books turn into movies because the actors they choose may not fit your imagination or scenes you fell in love with may not make it into the film. With After??? I was pleasantly surprised!!! The cast was perfect, I felt I was experiencing their experiences as the movie went on. I was completely engulfed in the romantic relationship but more importantly by how Hero and Josephine were BOTH able to portray those strong emotions so effortlessly. They both are great actors and take their craft SERIOUSLY. I certainly hope we see more. Also, the soundtrack for this movie was PERFECT, sometimes you get a good soundtrack and you watch the film and it seems the songs dont ""match"" the scene you're looking at, but that was not the case at all!! Honestly, it's very evident the hardwork that went into this movie by everyone! Congrats to Anna, Hero, Josephine, Khadijah, Shane and just the whole gang!!! #proudafternator",5
After,"The film is incredible, all changes were necessary, do not enter the movie theater thinking that you will see the book written in image, you will see After 2019, an improved and amazing version!! I love",5
After,If you love romances full of drama then you should definitely watch After! It's based on the first book and part of the second book of the series but the movie itself is a bit different from both. The acting was pretty good and the visuals and cinematography overall was breathtaking.,5
After,"I loved this movie. Yes there were changes from the book, but there is a huge difference in how much you can include in a book vs. a movie. I think the changes were great and those who have read the book need to go into the movie with an open mind. I had a friend accompany me who has never read the book and she absolutely loved the movie and how relatable it was, especially to her college experience freshman year. Sure, there were some things I wish were included and I wish there could've been more time to explain certain things, but like I said there is only so much you can include in a movie adaptation. I think the changes benefited the movie for an overall audience to make it appeal to everyone, and not just book readers. There absolutely NEEDS to be a sequel, especially with the way the movie ended. 10/10 for acting and chemistry, loved the leads. 10/10 for the whole movie. would 100% recommend.",5
After,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE. I loved it because it was a true ADAPTATION of the After books which .... were not my favorite read to be honest. This movie fixed everything that I didn't like about the books. For example, it brought a diversity of personalities which you don't see in the books and there were way less ""Tessa crying"" moments, which were so repetitive in the books. HERO played Hardin AMAZINGLY WELL. I never thought they could find an actor who would so closely resemble Hardin--but they did. I remember Hero playing the young Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and I knew instantly that his career would take off when he got older. His ability to play dark, brooding characters is truly phenomenal.Josephine was absolutely beautiful, confident and strong. She is the Tessa I prefer to the Tessa in the books. Her smile, her eyes, her voice, everything she did was perfect. She LOOKED exactly as I pictured in my head.For those diehard fans of After that didn't like it, I truly feel bad. However, movies are never like the books.....take Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings just as a few examples.This movie is so romantic and beautifully filmed. It is not a waste of your money so please go see it!!!!!!!!!!!",5
After,Recommend. greatest movie so far this year. go see right away!!!,5
After,I thought the movie was good! Since I read the books my brain was filling in some blanks that they left out which is fine because you can't do everything in the movie adaption. The acting was pretty good considering how new to acting they are. I enjoyed it. I want to see it a couple more times to get the chance o a sequel up.,4
After,"Josephine the girl who plays the lead role is the main reason to watch this average romantic drama which without Josephine would be boring as hell if u exclude last half an hour or so but Josephine and her chemistry with the the guy who played the other main role makes this movie worth of your time.
thank god we finally got something worth of a scenario twist in last 20 minutes and the movie ended strong but at the end Josephine is the reason to watch this film.",4
After,"The book and the movie were very different from one another so when I watched the film it was hard to not want more. I feel like they did a great job with the casting, and I loved the actors chemistry! It was such a beautiful film, but I feel like a lot of people might be disappointed if they compared it to the books. If you separate them, you will enjoy the movie on its own. It definitely had a lot of potential, and I feel like they could have made the movie longer so that people who haven't read the book would understand what was going on because their love story felt rushed at the beginning. However, I really want them to make a second film and focus on keeping the relationship complicated. This film didn't really have any fights scenes, and I feel like it was a big part of what made their relationship so complicated. They definitely needed to expand the Hardin's character more so the viewers could see why Hardin was the way he was. Either ways, I loved the ending and overall the film left me feeling happy.",5
After,"Have i words to explain how much this film is amazing?No. Yes,i'm speechless,there aren't words or adjectives worthy of this film,it's more than amazing.
Why?
it isn't just a teen love story, it teaches a lot, especially for the age in which we live, it has been adapted for an audience in 2019. we all need to get a message from this film, everyone has their own. And i think it isn't comparable to other films. And obviously the acting exceeds the perfection, the actors identified themselves in their character and made the film truly believable and spectacular.
What are you waiting for?Go to the cinema,now!",5
After,"I have not read the books, and nor did the people I saw the movie with.....but we all really enjoyed it! I can say this, no book will ever be perfectly adapted into a movie.....so people need to calm down when trying to compare. Taking a few hundred page novel and fitting it into 100 script pages is just not going to happen. That said, it's a well acted and great story. The soundtrack is amazing, and it's a fun trip to the movies. A great date movie.",5
Miracle,"During the 2010 Winter Olympics, NBC broadcast a 30-minute documentary piece on the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team. While I knew the story of how they beat the Soviets and won the Gold Medal (I had seen it live as a kid), I was expecting some clichd rhetoric about the team and what they had done, akin to films like ""Knute Rockne, All American"" (1940) and ""Rocky"" (1976). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story was anything but. The coach of that team, Herbert Brooks, was no hackneyed clone of a Knute Rockne or a Vince Limbardo. Instead he was a tight-fisted uncompromising hockey general who distanced himself from his players, more like a Bobby Knight than a Knute. This was not someone with whom teammates would feel comfortable having a beer. Instead, his inspiration to the players came from the other direction, by exposing their weaknesses and in some cases using unfairness and resentment as anchors from which to get the best out of his players. I decided that ""Miracle"" might be worth a look, especially as a prelude to the US vs Canada in the gold medal round of 2010 Olympic Hockey.Kurt Russell portrays Herbert Brooks as a lean and mean hockey coach who leaves sentimentality at the front door of the ice hockey rink. From the get-go he informs his players he's not there to be their friend. His goal is to let loose their highest playing potential coupled with the best conditioning among the Olympic hockey players at all costs. At times, he seems to be driving the players too hard well-beyond their comfort zones. Much of the story is the unconventional training techniques he uses to prepare the players for the 1980 Winter Olympics. According to the film, Brooks is relatively new to these techniques which he adopted while studying USSR hockey. His plan is to use the Soviets' techniques against them in the Olympics, which is not just about strategy but also about extreme discipline and an uncompromising tough sensibility akin to the military. One character points out that everything Brooks does has a purpose behind it. The only short-coming in the script may be the portrayal of Brooks' wife who finds her relationship with her husband compromised, at least according to the film. I wondered if it played out in real life as in the film or if it was fabricated by the screenwriters. Too many sports movies have this sort of relationship with the wife acting as the balance between the obsessive coach and the needs of his family. She's been through this before. Why did she marry him in the first place? To be a successful account?Certainly, most Americans know the outcome of the story, although the sequence of the game between the US and the Soviets is riveting and plays out about as well as the fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed. However, the meat of the story is really about the relationship between Brooks and his players, and the coach's single-minded determination to create the best Olympic team possible. By putting a certain amount of anger and determination into their hearts and heads, Brooks brings out the best in them, much like a sergeant in boot camp. The speech before the Americans played the Soviets is one of the better scenes of its type, leaving behind the ""do it for the Gipper"" silliness that has become a sports clich. The only moment which was lacking in the film was the speech before the very final game when the US played Finland after the Soviets. In that speech, apparently Brooks told his team that if they didn't win, they would go to their graves regretting the missed opportunity. I would have liked to have seen Russell give that speech as well. Apparently Herb Brooks died before the principal shooting of this film had ended, and the film is dedicated to him. Just about as fitting a tribute as a coach could ask for.",4
Miracle,"'Miracles do happen', the announcer's original broadcast is heard during the scenes recreated for this movie, 'Miracle.' Anyone who remembers what happened during those Winter Olympics in 1980 will know what this movie is about, and how it ends. However, there can be no spoilers, because this is not a movie about a hockey game, or even the sport of hockey. Nor is it about the players. It is solely about the coach, Herb Brooks, who, with his unconventional style and wisdom about the game, took these young hockey players to a level no one thought possible. In the end it didn't really matter whether they won or lost the game against the Russian. What mattered was that each of the 20 players found out what was possible inside himself.The movie begins with a montage of scenes from the period, the years, leading up to the selection of the Olympic hockey team in the summer of 1979. The cold war. The oil shortage and long gasoline lines. The disgraced President Nixon. The embattled President Carter. The Russians invading Afganistan. Then we see coach Brooks doing it his own way. A year and a half of scouting, one day of try-outs, to pick the 26 players which would eventually be cut to 20 for the competition. The DVD extras show us how much went into making the movie faithful, including a session with Brooks himself, who died in an accident right after filming was wrapped up. A very fine movie of a very inspirational journey.",0
Miracle,"Don't let the fact that this is a Disney movie deter you from watching a thoroughly enjoyable and adult-level sports movie for two-plus hours. Kurt Russell does an excellent job portraying coach Herb Brooks as a complex and sometimes ruthless and inscrutable leader. Very UN-Disney-like indeed. I am not a hockey fan - in fact I dislike the game intensely - yet I enjoyed the well-crafted scenes of competitive team play. Knowing the outcome of the BIG GAME did not detract at all from the excitement and suspense surrounding it. Sort of like the suspense Ron Howard achieved in Apollo 13 (where we knew in advance the outcome, but were worried about and later relieved for our astronauts). A must-see for sports fans and non-fans alike.",4
Miracle,"I was wary at first of  Disney production of this film. I didn't want the cheesy Mighty Ducks type of sports movie, especially when dealing with the awesome task completed by these players. I thought the film makers did a nice job and the movie itself was quite entertaining. I think it exposes a whole generation to the 1980 U.S. hockey team and what they accomplished. Even though I am not a fan of Kurt Russell, I thought he was very good as Herb Brooks. He had the mannerisms and the voice down very well. Russell is a huge hockey fan himself so I know it was honor for him to play Brooks. For die hard hockey fans, this movie will entertain and it does not poison the game action or what it is really like to play hockey.",4
Miracle,"I am the child of two St. Paul east- siders.  My father has loved hockey for as long as he can remember.  My mom, well, she just likes sports in general. Hockey ruled my life from the very first moments.  First my father's practices and games, then my little brother, later on there were boyfriends, friends, high school, and college.  Now there is Gophers and Wild. I imagine that hockey will continue to define my life for a very long time.That said, for Minnesota kids there are legends told to them from the beginning.  How Paul Bunyan shaped our lakes and rivers, and lived ""Up North"", and there is Herb Brooks.  Legends that define Minnesota heritage.Herb Brooks was a man who shaped the way hockey is viewed in Minnesota.  A stand out at St. Paul Johnson High School, and at the U.  He went to coach his beloved Gophers and work with his idol John Mariucci.  Now the ice at Mariucci Arena (not 2 miles from where I sit now) bears tribute to Herby. His coaching techniques are still used and abused throughout the state.Kurt Russell paid apt tribute to our late leader, and I am positive he would be impressed.  I was fortunate enough to get sneak-preview tickets to see Miracle, and I can honestly say I don't remember when I had such a good time at the movies.  I don't think I stopped smiling once.  Russell's accent was good throughout the movie, but on just a few lines I could have SWORN that he was a Minnesotan.  He elongated his vowels very well.Eddie Cahill did a superb job as Jim Clark.  I wondered how exactly he would play someone so torn between immense sadness and undeniable pride. I was even more impressed with his hockey skills.  I hope that this helps the very yummy Mr. Cahill move from TV-boyfriend dujor (friends, Sex and the City) to a great movie actor.  As it is the only thing that disappointed me was that he was running around the Cities last summer, and I had no idea.If you are still reading this it goes without saying that I think you should see this movie.  Sure you know how it ends, you've probably seen the game at least once on ESPN Classic even if you are old enough to remember it in the first place.  The portrayal of our country at such a dark time in the world's history is historically great.  Apt tribute is paid to Afghanistan (even if we are repeating the USSR's mistakes now), the Ayatollah, the oil embargo, and the general distrust in government.  The Miracle on Ice was a very bright spot in a very dark time, and Miracle does a wonderful job showing just that.  To those who say, who outside the US cares?  I say hockey fans care.  Sports fans care.  This is not just a hockey movie (though it is a great one); it is a movie about hard work and perseverance. Isn't that what America really stands for?So, Bravo Disney.  I think Herby would have been pleased.  I know that I am.",0
Miracle,"I was too young to have known anything about this game when it was played in real life, but it was definitely more than a game. It concerned world politics and the cold war. The movie did a good job showing how seemingly impossible it seemed for the young American team to beat the best team in the world who had been playing together for 10 years. And Kurt Russell did a good job as the tough coach who was hard on the players to get the most out of them. I also liked the way the hockey games were filmed. I think hockey is the most boring sport and I don't know any of the rules, but the way it was filmed let the least knowlegdable person follow what was going on.FINAL VERDICT: If you like sports movies, then don't miss this one.",0
Miracle,"It's hard to recreate the magic of a once-in-a-lifetime event, but Miracle comes pretty close. It succeeds in recapturing the spirit of the times, the personality of coach Herb Brooks, the tension of the game, and the exhilaration of Al Michaels' famous call as the clock went to 0:00. While there are plenty of minor things I could quibble about, Miracle's ability to recapture the spirit of the Soviet upset makes it a success. A movie about this subject could easily have been a stinker, but Miracle isn't that at all. It's a great sports movie that suffers only in comparison to the real story. I gave it 8/10.",0
Miracle,"MIRACLE, the Disney retelling of the U.S. Hockey squad's astonishing Gold Medal performance at Lake Placid in 1980, is not a great film (a TV-movie from 1981, ""Miracle on Ice"", despite the bizarre casting of 69-year old Karl Malden as 43-year old coach Herb Brooks, is superior, although relying heavily on TV footage for game sequences), but it does offer Kurt Russell in one of the finest performances of his long career.The 53-year old Russell, a life-long veteran of both TV and film (making his debut on a ""Sugarfoot"" TV episode, at age 6), has developed a reputation over the past two decades as a very competent, if not overpowering leading man, primarily in action films (ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, TOMBSTONE, BREAKDOWN) and comedies (USED CARS, CAPTAIN RON, OVERBOARD). What is often forgotten, however, is that he has remarkable 'range' as an actor, with brilliant performances in the TV-movie ""Elvis"" (1979), the underrated SWING SHIFT (1984, where he met his long-time love, Goldie Hawn), and 2003's DARK BLUE (as a crooked cop searching for redemption during the bloody aftermath of the Rodney King riots in L.A.). As age has carved his features, Russell has lost the ""beach boy"" glamor that had often 'stereotyped' him in the past, and gives his 'Herb Brooks' a sense of credibility and pain that lifts his performance to Academy Award caliber.Herb Brooks was a remarkable person, long before Lake Placid. Despite success in coaching a string of national champion college hockey teams, he had never recovered from being the last player 'cut' from the 1960 Gold Medal U.S. hockey squad, and from being a member of the '64 and '68 teams that were humiliated by the Soviets. Driven by a desire to beat the nearly invincible Russian squad, he realized that a group of college 'all-stars' would never possess the 'team' skills to get the job done. Ruthlessly, refusing the assistance of the U.S. Olympic Hockey Committee, he pieced together a squad of talented skaters, 'broke' them, then remolded them to fit his vision, working them unmercifully for over six months, while spouting Vince Lombardi-like platitudes. Despite his torturous regimen, just days before the Olympics, his team would be humiliated by the Soviets, 10-3, and no one gave his squad a chance for a medal.But Brooks had faith, and a squad that was 'hungry'...While the film suffers from a lack of depth in the portrayal of the players (by the way, they do all their own skating; TV footage is not used), MIRACLE's 'feel' of the decade is well-done, using montages and voice-overs to convey the American sense of helplessness in a decade of tragedies. The unexpected U.S. victory galvanized the nation (Al Michaels' stunned reaction, ""Do you believe in Miracles?"", has become a catch phrase for both the game, and the times), and actually contributed to turning the country around.While the Academy Awards will probably ignore Kurt Russell's commanding performance (as the film was not a 'hit'), MIRACLE is still a film worth viewing, given our own troubled times. While the film may not be 'great', it's message of hope is certainly worthwhile!",0
Miracle,"Miracle is a Walt Disney movie about hockey. This sounds like Mighty Ducks, but believe me, it's not. Miracle stands on its own as a great movie. Disney has made true stories about sports in the past like Remember the Titans, and movies like that had the same Disney feel. Miracle is a movie for everyone to go see. It is a wonderful movie about a true game in history.This movie tells the story of Herb Brooks. Brooks works endlessly studying films and picking players to represent the United States in the Olympics. He doesn't just see this as a job, but he sees it as a second chance. Brooks was on the 1960 Olympic hockey team, but just before they left to compete, Brooks was cut from the team. The team went on to win, but Herb Brooks wasn't there to get the gold. Now this is his chance to win. The movie starts with Brooks getting the job and from there we see his plan. Brooks tells his players from the start how he's not going to be their friend, but he's going to be their coach. When Brooks says something he means it. Brooks changes the way the Americans play and he teaches them the way their tough opponents play. Brooks plans to beat them at their own game. It seems impossible in the beginning for Brooks to get these young guys that have never played together, and teach them a whole new way to play. It also seems impossible for the USA team to defeat the Soviet Union. The Soviets seem like an unstoppable force that can't be beaten. When you see the Soviets in action it does look impossible, but this movie shows how nothing is impossible. Miracle really doesn't go into all of the players, except Jim Craig. Craig and his father are going through a tough time because of Mrs. Craig's death. You see Jim struggle and all you want throughout the movie is for him to win the big one for his family. Besides Jim Craig, you're never really introduced to the rest of the guys. The only one that you're with throughout the movie is Herb Brooks, well portrayed by Kurt Russell. You see what it's like to assemble a winning team. You also see Brooks getting so caught up in his work that he has no time for his family. All you want is for this guy to win.This movie is more than just a sports movie. It is a movie that shows dreams can come true. You watch a team of young guys bond and become a family. You see these guys win from all of their hard work and determination. Their win at the time was a miracle and even today watching this movie you get the same great feeling that these guys did the impossible. This is a great sports movie and even if you don't like sports, it is still a great movie.I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is a movie that you should definitely see if you're down because it is a movie about hope. It is also about victory and when the movie is over it will have every red-blooded American cheering for the good old USA. This movie must have done something right because it had everyone get just as excited as they would have been years ago. When the USA team shoots that final goal to make the score 4 to 3 and the clock starts to wind down, you see everyone getting more and more excited. Finally when the clock runs out and you see that the USA has won, everyone is on their feet cheering. Then when the American flag is waved high in the air you hear the people in the theater cheering USA. Miracle made you feel as if you were back in time witnessing the real game. The movie lets you know what's going on at the time with clips from history and it is just amazing how a film can do this. Be sure not to miss this spectacular film. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. The movie is well written, well acted, and well filmed so Miracle gets a Hat Trick.",5
Miracle,"Kurt Russell does a wonderful job of portraying Herb Brooks, an innovative hockey coach, and a hard-driving motivator of the young American team that competed at, and won, the 1980 Lake Placid Olympic hockey championship. Indeed, everyone is great, including the hockey players who learned to act to portray the famous group of college amateur players that Brooks pulled together to form a tight-knit and well-conditioned squad.Camera work and re-creation of key plays is amazing -- maybe the best hockey footage ever shot (see the DVD special features). Also touching is the collage of tragic events involving the USA in the 60's and 70's, leading up to the Olympics. By the way: I found the (voiceover) speech we hear from 1980 by Jimmy Carter (""The USA has a crisis of confidence.."") as moving as MLK's famous ""I have a dream"" speech. It sets the stage nicely for the events that follow - we all need a dream from time to time, or maybe a Miracle.And you don't feel sorry for the Russians, this the last vestige of an arrogant cold-war-produced hockey machine: seasoned veterans laying out college kids with nasty body-checks, or slashes (just in case you thought us Canucks had the patent rights to tough hockey). Good news, though: the USA was up to it, repaying hefty checks in spades.Finally, there is is some insight into Brooks hockey ideas, years ahead of their time: carefully-rehearsed breakout plays, circle patterns of player movement, and short 40-50 second shifts to keep players fresh.There is a nice up-to-dater on where the players were in 2006 when the film was made, but the NHL careers were overlooked - several of these guys went on to have stellar careers in professional hockey. The talent level was substantial.Anyway-- good job all around.",5
Miracle,"Miracle is, in my book, a great sports film. Disney is finally able to come back with a smash hit sports film. Miracle follows the true-life story of Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) and his team in there goal of winning the 1980 Olympic games in hockey. Standing against them is the seemingly invincible Russian squad who the team must overcome.The film follows the entire team from training, to the cut lists, and right to the Olympics. Instead of a dragging sap story, Disney decides to focus the movie more equally with Herb Brooks and his family and the team and there own little family they've formed between themselves. I'm really not to fond of the sport of hockey but the scenes on the ice are beautifully crafted and filmed. The drama is well-placed and you feel as if your part of the team and feeling everything they do. I really found this movie to be good. Kurt Russell is great as Coach Brooks and he is supported by some great actors as his team and some of the sons of the actual players who won the game. This is a great sports drama, no Hoosiers but very, very close.Miracle. Starring: Kurt Russell, Patricia Clarkson, Noah Emmerich, and Sean McCann.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",4
Miracle,"This was a pretty nice movie overall. It had its bad points but they were more subtle. The good stuff was out in front: the realistic hockey scenes and the inspiring true-life story of an amazing underdog sports team pulling off the ""miracle."" That, of course, was the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team winning the gold medal and along the way becoming the first team in 20 years to defeat the Soviets.The story also is about Herb Brooks, the coach of the team. Everything in here centers around him. Kurt Russell does a nice job playing him, although I don't understand the Polish accent Russell used. Why would Brooks have a Polish accent?Over the years, sports movies - as in other genres - are becoming more and more realistic. This was about as good as it gets in that regard. A number of the actors are players, meaning they know how to skate. A documentary with the DVD shows the great lengths they went to in filming this in order make the action look realistic. It's not fake; these guys know how to play the game and the camera-work, along with the sound, is outstanding.For a fairly long film (135 minutes) this film moves by fast and the drama is there but not super-intense since everyone knows the final result. The story is basically, as mentioned, about Brooks and the way he molded a group of kids together to play so well as a team. Many of his ideas would not have been implemented had others had a say, but Brooks proved them all wrong.The only part of the film that was totally unnecessary was the typical Liberal slant that Hollywood just has to put in our faces every chance it gets. Here, they do it by quick cheap shots against Republican Presidents while airing an inspirational speech by Democrat Jimmy Carter. They have just stuck with the hockey angle, which the filmmakers here did extremely well. Still, it's a very good sports movie that even non- hockey fans should enjoy.",5
Miracle,"In 1980, Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), a former Olympics hockey player cut from the winning 1960 U.S. team, put together a ragtag band of college hockey players, taking them to the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid to face the seemingly invincible Russian hockey team, winners of four successive gold medals. Miracle tells the true story of how they worked together to defy the odds working against them. Everyone likes a good upset especially when they can cheer on the winning team. Miracle gives you that story and its a nice film to watch with your family. I don't watch hockey because I don't really like it and its just not very appealing to me. But there's things that non-hockey fans can enjoy from this film. I liked the determination from the team and the inspiration the coach gave to them. Kurt Russell does an awesome job as Herb Brooks, probably his best performance in a long time. Patricia Clarkson does a good job playing his wife and all the players on the team aren't bad either. The one actor that was bad was Noah Emmerich, he just showed little to no emotion and didn't really put in a good effort. This wouldn't had been a problem if he had a small role but he was the assistant coach. Miracle is directed by Gavin O'Connor and he does a good job. The hockey itself wasn't actually that bad as some scenes of the game were pretty cool. The focus is on mainly on Russell and while you learn some stuff about the players it would had been nice if they had shifted some of the attention on them as well. The screenplay may be filled with clichs but the film does it right even if it feels like you have seen it before because you probably have. The film is 135 minutes long and for me it started dragging a little and getting kind of boring. The movie is also predictable so the ending game as well as the entire movie isn't really suspenseful. The focus is more on beating Russia then actually winning the medal. When they do play in the final game and win the medal, they only show them scoring the winning shot. After that Kurt Russell starts talking saying how they won the last game by coming up from behind. While we know the outcome to the whole thing it still would had been nice if they had added a few more scenes. Its also better then The Mighty Ducks but that's not a hard thing to do. Rating 7/10 a treat for hockey fans and a film that a normal movie-goer can enjoy.",3
Miracle,"At first I thought.... there is way too much dialog and way too little hockey (or humor) ... but that all changed in the second half of the movie which made the first half well worth the wait. Kurt Russell plays the no-nonsense Herb Brooks, the coach of the 1980 Olympic Hockey team that won the Olympic Gold. (Do you remember where you were?)I guess what most impressed me about the film was how amazing the editing and camera work was. I think it will count as a ""first"" in a lot of categories, not the least of which was camera work. The way they spliced the actual historical footage, (courtesy of the Olympic Committee) with the new footage and the actors, was so seamless and elegant, and the result was quite compelling and original. I don't think I've ever seen such well executed editing before, not even in the Hobbit movies ;-).
The story itself was sweet and compelling. Kurt Russell was great, in that you come to a point where you really hate this bastard so much, you just want to say, ""No, You skate again you mother(bleep)er!"" I love the 70's haircuts and clothes and the accents.. the larger issues of the Cold War are not too fore fronted, but they are present enough that you see how important the win is for the US. Also, you see that his coaching really did pay off in the end: There is a point where the MC says, ""the US has never out-skated the Soviets like this before..."" and you recall the practice that Brooks makes them skate even after the rink has closed. (He was pretty brutal.) The Russian players are down-right frightening, so you get a real sense of what these kids are up against... they can hardly make eye contact they are so intimidated... but in the end, the ""eye scene"" as I call it, is enough to make even the biggest cynic, ""get veclemt"".Some people have called the film vapid nationalism (others are p***ed off because it was filmed entirely in Canada) but I think it was more about what a team of players (not any one individual or prima dona player) can do. It was also the last time a team of real amateurs actually won, before players became entertainers commanding million plus salaries, so I guess it has some important historical value.The film also has a real ""Indie"" feel. It stars all kinds of unknowns and has all kinds of low-budget effects, the scenes mostly taking place on the rink or in locker rooms. There are many moments when your heart breaks for some of the players and their families.I enjoyed it immensely and it sort of re-awakened my interest in hockey, which I'd long written off as too violent... Even the early fight scene between a player from Boston and Minnesota, which the coach encourages: ""Don't stop them,"" he says to his assistant coach, played awesomely by Noah Emmerich (remember, Jim Carey's best buddy in the Truman Show?)  is endurable when seen within the larger mission. Sadly this coach died in real life, according to the movie, before it was released... I guess he died just recently (and suddenly, though I don't know the whole story.)Anyhow I give it 8 out of 10 stars. A good and somewhat sad movie about a history that now seems too distant.",0
Miracle,"Miracle is one of the better sports movies that I have seen. The movie portrays the United States team's unlikely Gold Medal victory at the 1980 Winter Olympics. It does one hell of a job at capturing one of the greatest moments in sports history.There are many elements that make the movie great. The actors really get into it and make you believe they are the players. Kurt Russell turns in an astounding performance as Team USA's coach Herb Brooks.The critical event in the movie however is the time period and events surrounding everything. The Miracle On Ice occurred during the Cold War and not long after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Morale was deteriorating at home and the country was in desperate need of a morale booster. That came in the form of a hockey game.The Soviet Union had been the dominant hockey power for years winning gold medals in 64, 68, 72, and 76. The US is a team made up of young college kids molded into an effective unit by coach Herb Brooks. The US would end up playing the Soviets as a huge underdog. It is a story of the little team that could versus the superpower. David versus Goliath basically. The events taking place made this more then a hockey game. This was a competition between 2 countries with heightened tensions. Even before the puck drops you can feel the intensity in the air.Overall you don't have to like hockey or know an ice skate from a roller skate to appreciate this movie. It is an unlikely underdog story surrounded by international turmoil. The movie is inspiring and the best fact is it really happened. Miracle is a must see.",5
Miracle,"Even if you're not a sports fan you can appreciate this movie for being historically accurate. Compared to other sports movies, this one and ""Hoosiers"" are the two best ever made.It begins with scenes from the 70's and they do a great job throughout pointing out the Iran hostage crisis, gasoline shortages and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, yet not to the point where any of those things are overdone. I wish they would've shown more of the gold medal game against Finland, but the movie was already long enough and it might have taken away from the drama of beating the Soviets. As for other things, Kurt Russell is excellent as Coach Brooks. My favorite scenes with him are the ""Great Moments"" speech and when he tells the team of the Russian style of play and how they can play with them by attacking rather than defending. And I love the fact that they got a small clip of the famous Mean Joe Greene Coke Commercial, which in fact came out at that time, the fall of 1979.The outcome is predictable, since we all know who won, but in spite of that, this movie has plenty of drama and suspense. Finally, this is also a family friendly movie--no excessive profanity or sexual scenes. Definitely a ""10"" in my book.",5
Miracle,"The film Miracle (2004) directed by Gavin O'Connor, tells the true story of Herb Brooks, the coach of the struggling US Olympic Hockey Team in his quest to beat the odds. Both the Movie Miracle and the events which it chronicled were set in the year 1980. At this time there was great upheaval in the world because the US and the USSR were embattled in a prolonged cold war, where neither nation trusted the other. The competitive nature between the two countries was seen in all aspects but especially in sports. The Soviet hockey team at this time was considered to be unbeatable previously winning the Olympics for twenty years straight. The film follows Brooks on his journey to transform a group of young and inexperienced US Hockey players into a cohesive team and overcome the best hockey team in the world.Miracle stars the accomplished actor Kurt Russell as the notorious Herb Brooks, a tough and fearless hockey coach, determined to win. Russell was able to capture the personality of Brooks so well that at times it feels as if it were really Brooks on the bench directing his team. He achieves not only the look, but the body language, facial expressions and Minnesotan accent as well. The event of the 1980 winter Olympics at Lake Placid is recreated so well throughout the movie that the natural performances of the actors only helped to enhance the feeling of really being there. The young actors picked to portray the team play their roles perfectly. Unlike other movies the majority of the cast in Miracle were not professional actors; in fact many of the actors had never acted before. The director cast actual hockey players so that the viewer can really experience the bond of a team and to ensure that the performances' of the actors would feel realistic.One of the most convincing performances in the film comes from Eddie Cahill who plays Jim Craig. Cahill is able to illustrate through his acting the immense amount of pressure he was going through as the goalie of the team. His role was pivotal to the film because it helped the viewer understand what it was like to be on both sides, from the perspective of both player and coach. The actors used to portray the team are successful in their pursuits and their acting as a collective creates a feeling of unity. The actors work well together and create a truly believable team.If you are a fan of inspirational sports films Miracle will not disappoint. It has everything you are looking for in this genre of film and more. The film is both interesting and entertaining and will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Miracle was made with such passion and enthusiasm that the real players who lived it support the film proudly. The film is a fitting tribute to Brooks who died before the film was finished and is dedicated to him in the closing credits.",5
Miracle,"I stopped myself from chanting USA USA in the theater, because my wife would have left, but I still got emotional and raised my hands up when the US scored.  I still miss the Jets leaving the Peg, and still have the game reflexes when I watched the movie with a hockey crowd.  I remember watching most of the games when I was eleven.  Everyone hated the big Red machine from the Soviet Union, that killed the NHL all stars, and team USA afterward in a pre-Olympic game.  Part of the cold war fever taking place and this movie showed the importance of the game back in 1980. I was chanting USA USA while watching the game, live at home and remember Craig with the flag, all the players standing on the podium during the medal ceremony.  This must of had a huge influence on Hockey in the USA, and turned a lot of youngsters onto the game!  Being a hockey nut I remember watching the US during the 80's and they would lose in the first round at the Canada cups but with the younger players coming up they got better in every tournament, and finally made the cup final in 1992.  This event and the infusion of Canadian junior hockey coaches into their college system makes the US, the hockey power it is today.  Is is no longer just Canada and the Russians, I figure there will be many Canada, USA olympic gold medal games with maybe a movie about it one day.  Great hockey movie the advisors made the goaltending, and puck movement so real.  Russell looks and acts like a coach, from the coaching view, not the fan.  Brooks later became the coach of the Rangers, it was classy of them showing his picture at the end of the movie. 7 out of 10",4
Miracle,Rousing sports film about the 1980 U.S. Hockey team features some nicely shot game footage and a solid performance from Kurt Russell as the driven coach. Suffers from some formula moments and a clunky subplot with Russell's wife (Patricia Clarkson) but otherwise a fine piece of entertainment. GRADE: B,4
Miracle,"Kurt Russell gave an absolute towering performance as the U.S. hockey team coach in charge of getting his team to defeat an excellent Soviet team in the Olympics in this 2004 film.The picture reminded me greatly of the 1988 basketball film where Gene Hackman was also quite a stickler.Though the Russell character of Herb Brooks did ultimately have a heart, he drove his players. His making of players repeat certain items for hours on end was memorable.The picture has a back drop of events occurring in our nation from the turbulent times of the late '60s and '70s. The hockey contest between the U.S. and the USSR became one of a political nature due to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Patricia Clarkson plays Russell's wife. She is understanding and when push comes to shove, she stands by her man.",5
Miracle,"this movie is so much more than just a sports movie. it deals with the issues of the cold war and communism. it also shows how the country was helped by the seemingly impossible win against the soviets. the casting is perfect, down to the regional accents. the hockey scenes are absolutely unbelievable, and the hockey players turned actors are wonderful. Jim Craig, Jack O'Callahan, and MIke Eruzione each display a touching story that follows them through their struggles on the 1980 hockey team. Kurt Russell's acting is so fierce, that I almost couldn't tell the difference between him and the real Herb Brooks at the end. Although some scenes are absolutely heart-wrenching, the movie as a whole is absolutely inspiring. And it helps that the young hockey boys are easy on the eyes.",5
Miracle,"I'm not a big sports fanatic and yet I keep falling in love with these incredible emotionally powerful and moving sports films, specifically Disney's as of late. The deeply moving, touching and just plain nice Greatest Game Ever Played and now finally I get around to seeing 2004's Miracle. Miracle was quite simply incredible. Well acted, beautifully directed, powerful, invigorating and touching. People certainly consider it controversial calling the film historically inaccurate, American driven, and over hyped and perhaps it is but I don't think they are seeing the real story and message behind those games. This was the end of an era. The Cold war raged for nearly five decades and this was like the pinnacle of the average American's involvement with the Cold War. This was a team that was going to take on the most powerful nation in the world not in war but in sport on ice, with rules. Fairly newcomer and unknown director Gavin O'Connor does an absolutely brilliant job of recapturing the spirit and turbulence of the seventies moving towards the end of the cold war. On top of making you remember those days and the seventies from politics to sports to the average person's life he manages to bring out this incredible story of people, a team and a Coach who would do anything to get this team that medal.Kurt Russell plays tough as nails Coach Herb Brooks. Hands down Russell gives an Oscar Worthy performance. He was robbed because I am certain he belonged up there. His performance as Herb Brooks is moving and so diverse. We see every angle of him, his passion for hockey, his love for his family, and his utter raw determination to train this team to be the best in the world through all odds. Russell is as good for the team as he is downright cruel but his methods are all for good reason as we see. Any Russell fan as I am NEEDS to see this movie. He is incredible. He is by far the star and stand out performance in the film. Granted the film really is about him and Herb Brooks' story. The rest of the cast is very much supporting cast but they all do a great job. The hockey team in particular are all so important and I would love to list them all but sadly I won't. I will say though that they are all fantastic and they all have their moments. I have to mention Eddie Cahill, for a couple of reasons. First of all I am a huge CSI New York Fan which he is a regular cast member of. But more importantly he does a great job as intense goalie Jim Craig. Craig gets a bit more of a back story having his mother pass away and her wish for him to play for the Olympic team. Seeing Craig's father (Malcolm Stewart) at his final game cheering him on was moving!! Cahill's performance is moving and he is so intense and a powerful presence on screen. Patrick O'Brien Demsey, Kenneth Mitchell, Eric Peter-Kaiser, and Bobby Hanson are some of the more prominent members of the team and they are just fantastic. Much like the story of this team they are an on screen team. An ensemble cast who works together flawlessly. Noah Emmerich plays Assistant coach Craig Patrick and he is good. I found him a little low brow up against such powerful performances especially Russell but still he is a worthy addition to the cast.Miracle is a classic film, case closed. It goes into my books as one of my all time favorites. I won't ever forget Herb Brooks screaming...AGAIN!...and Craig Patrick reluctantly blowing his whistle to force the boys to do drills till they are literally sick. It captures an era, a moment in history of sports that won't ever be topped quite likely. A shining moment in US History and an important moment to many. Whatever people may say about Miracle it will give you shivers, make you smile, it's the feel good movie of the decade. I will watch this again and again and again...FANTASTIC!! 10/10",5
Miracle,"Thanks mostly to the guys that actually won the gold, but thanks as well to the actor/hockey players that made the film possible.

I recently got cut from my pick-up league team, because I turned 40 last February 14th.......they let me slide for a while..but the age limit is 40.

Miranda House,"Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just interview after interview, we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring. So why didn't I give it ten stars? Well, the ending was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. And in parts, the film became offensive in trying to be funny - but that's Ali G for you - if it isn't offensive, it isn't itself, and it is totally and utterly ruined. Ali G's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have got into the 6-7 average rating range on IMDb. But it could have got worse as well, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a film such as this.On the whole, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best - and funniest, and most clever. A great job! 9/10",5
Miranda House,"Ali G Indahouse has got to be one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and Cohen's portrayal of a British gangsta is hilarious. This film has cult classic written all over it, and it features some really great lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good-time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end. Definitely Vote Ali G and keep it real.",4
Miranda House,"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon). After this I will absolutely respect them even more, for having the good sense to take this chance. I have nothing really bad to say about this film, it's very funny. Very juvenile, but hey, so what?! One more thing to mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE!**** / *****",4
Miranda House,"As someone who usually despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I was watching it, I was in a hysterical fit. Yes it is sexist, rude and extremely crude, and I loved it. As some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes, this movie was laugh-a-thon. I have never seen a comedy as original as Ali G Indahouse.For a comedy starring Ali G, this would be worthy of an 8 out 10. Absolutely Brilliant.",4
Miranda House,"The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour. Think of yourself as a teenager and you will love it - especially if the likes of Kevin & Perry Go Large tickled you!",5
Miranda House,"I first encountered the Ali G character a few months ago in the American import of his interview show in which he sets up unsuspecting celebrities and creates comedy at their expense. Since they are invariably people who feed on public attention, it is entirely appropriate to feed on them once in a while. But it takes a seriously misleading, confusing and outrageous character to pull it off, and Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) does it. Cohen thinks funny; Ali G is a hugely funny creation, in much the same way that another wild and crazy guy, Andy Kaufman, invented unforgettably outrageous characters. ""Ali G Indahouse"" is Ali G to the third power, cubed. The plot is suitably improbable, offering an appropriate springboard for the Ali G craziness. I laughed till I cried. The plot twisted around and ended happily, and there wasn't a clich that wasn't ragged on or a convention that wasn't exploited, and at every turn, the absurdity of the Ali G persona looms over all, ragging on itself and painting everything with its humor. I like the fact that Ali G is a white middle-class guy who has become a hip-hopper and gone native with it. In that way it's about re-creating oneself and then bumping up against conventional reality, which results in absurdities and humor, some attributable to the pretense of the invented persona and some to the ridiculous conventions it scrapes against. It could be a stretch and unfunny. It works and knocks 'em dead.Let me now back away from over-analyzing something that looks uncomplicated and isn't, but is hugely funny, and deserves just to be enjoyed. Roll with the humor of that crazy dude. He is a classic. Doug Wilson",0
Miranda House,"When most British TV comedies get given the big screen treatment they are usually terrible. This is one of the more successful attempts but is still no where near as funny as when Ali G was the telly. Ali G was hilarious on TV when he was interviewing unsuspecting politicians/scientists/vicars etc, and less so here in this cinematic adventure. It actually has a plot as Ali rises to become Primeminister of Great Britain! It has some very funny parts but not nearly enough of them, maybe its because Ali G has been around for about 3 years now and the concept is becoming a bit stale now. Although I loved the bit where Ali met Sacha's other comic creation ""Borat"", very clever and a nice pay off for fans of his TV show. ***6/10)***",3
Miranda House,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsMovie adaptations of TV shows,books or magazines are rarely very good,but Ali G Indahouse is one of those pleasing exceptions to the rule.The set-up for the comedy has the local authority closing down the community centre where Ali works and him going on hunger strike outside the Houses of Parliament.When Prime Minister Michael Gambon decides he needs someone young and hip to gain a wider appeal to the activites of his party,Ali is just the man for the job.Ali introduces his 'Keep it Real' policy,to the anger of Charles Dance's dastardly right-hand man who's planning to build over Staines.The frank honesty of Sacha Baren Cohen's character and the clever satire enterwine beautifully together.Big up yourself and go see this movie.****",0
Miranda House,"... and if you do too then you should watch this film. If you're a fan of Ali G then this film is definitely for you. It is very funny - Its probably not as funny as the TV show or the video as thats where Ali G's stupidity is in its element. While it wont go down as a great British movie, it definitely is one of the better ones and funnier than some more high profile movies, it is still very funny and childish. 7/10",0
Miranda House,"I used to love Sacha Baron Cohen`s creation of Ali G on THE 11 0`CLOCK SHOW in the late 90s . I also liked the spin off show though it should be pointed out by then the joke was wearing thin and it was obvious his guests were in on the joke of having a white boy impersonating a black ghetto boy wannabe . When ALI G INDAHOUSE was released I didn`t bother to see it because Ali was probably past his sell by date then . But my brother bought me the video of this film and watched it on Boxing day and I must confess it was a lot better than I expected ALI G INDAHOUSE is a very funny if you understand the "" Wigger "" culture of middle class white boys wishing they were black . I was laughing out loud at the first half of the film as Ali lays down the facts to his posse that wearing the wrong colours in the ghetto could cost you your life , and Ali on the election trail had me in absolute stitches as he drove down Staines high street giving a rap broadcast , but then the film goes slightly downhill as an extremely unlikely political plot takes shape and the jokes slow down So all in all ALI G INDAHOUSE is funny but slightly uneven . I still watch the video a couple of months after getting it but only the first half . It`s a lot better than getting socks for Christmas so thanks for the video Neill",3
Miranda House,"If you are a fan of smooth, hip talking or just a bit of hip hop, then you'll like this film, as for everyone else, you can enjoy Sacha Baron Cohen as the great Ali G. Borat (Cohen) also appears, but his own film is much better. Basically, Ali G lives in the West Side of Staines and is protesting about his Leisure Centre closing down. So he decides to join the Prime Minister (Sir Michael Gambon) and his nasty assistant David Carlton (Charles Dance) in parliament, hence the title, Indahouse. Also starring Kellie Bright as ""me"" Julie, Martin Freeman as Ricky C, the fit Rhona Mitra as Kate Hedges, Tony Way as Dave, EastEnders' Nabil Elouhabi as Jezzy F and Ray Panthaki as Hassan B, Naomi Campbell, newsreader Jon Snow, EastEnders' Rudolph Walker as President Mwepu, and Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan. Ali G was number 8 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, he was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments, along with Borat at number 24 (and Bruno at number 77), and he was number 6 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, with Borat at number 17, and Sacha Baron Cohen (or as the character) was number 12 on Britain's Favourite Comedian. Good!",3
Miranda House,"IMDb mark: 7What a fun film this is! Especially the beginning... 'Ali g Indahouse' has got to have one of the greatest, funniest intros ever! Even the opening credits are hilarious. But you have to be open-minded. This movie certainly isn't for the people who move their heads disapprovingly when they see you purchasing prophylactic wrappers. Getting back to the movie, this film is likely to offend not only older people but women, too. So, it is fairly obvious that the movie is intended for a restricted audience.-Humour: There is more than a fair share of swearing in this movie. There are more than a few sexist remarks in this film. And yes, they are extremely funny. But there are even a few very funny lines that aren't sexist or obscene. 25/25-Physical Comedy: Sacha Baron Cohen is the one who provides nearly all of the funny stuff in this film, but he does it really well. He finds himself in predicaments and tense moments throughout the whole film, and some of his reactions are priceless. 17/20-Plot: The plot is very far-fetched. One of Britain's party leaders decides to use a stupid young man he sees outside making a fool of himself in his plot to overthrow the Prime Minister. But that young man isn't just anyone, he is street tough Ali g, who is one bad dude. 6/15-Ending: I didn't think the ending was too great. Of course, taste varies. 4/10-Theme: Not all people can be judged by their exterior. 9/10-Nudity: There is no nudity in this film, although there are a couple of nude pictures of some unknown women briefly shown late in the film. 0/8-Cast: I hadn't heard of Sacha Baron Cohen before seeing this film, but apparently he is better-known in the United Kingdom, having his own series, 'Da Ali G Show'. Other somewhat famous actors in this movie are Rhona Mitra and Charles Dance, and there is a cameo appearance by Naomi Campbell. 2/8-Genre: This is a comedy. 4/4-->Overall: 67/100It's so nice and refreshing to see a good sexist, lewd comedy among this bland sea of chick comedies. Since 'Married... with Children', I haven't laughed this hard while seeing a new comedy. From Swordlord, 2 swords up!",0
Miranda House,"I have to admit that I love ""Da Ali G Show"" and purchased the first season as soon as it came out on DVD. So when I heard Sacha's movie was being released on DVD as well I wanted to rent it right away. One could say I had very high expectations as he is an extremely funny comedian so it was to my dismay that when it came time to actually watching the film it was complete and utter crap (for lack of a better term). I laughed probably 3-4 times tops throughout the whole duration which is pretty pathetic considering the main actor's potential. I mean I was well aware that it obviously didn't have a stellar budget but it still had so much more potential that it just couldn't live up to I guess. I was even more disappointed when I came to the realization that Mr. Cohen was actually one of the co-writers of this piece of garbage too because if he didn't help pen it then he could be considered less liable but once again to my chagrin...not in this case. I have seen a lot worse and I'm thinking I'm only being so hard on it since I went in with such high hopes but there are a handful of laughs, however don't act surprised when you find out it's nowhere near as funny as his TV show!Final Slant:Movies: I would've cried if I blew that much money on this!!DVD Purchase: I was tempted just to buy it first since I figured it'd be so good anyways...thank God I chose against this!Rental: Only if you're a big fan of Sacha's and can't get enough of him.",2
Miranda House,"My god how bad this is. Who is this impostor pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. It replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour.This was obviously an attempt to get him known in the States before he released his show there on HBO.One commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums. While it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen Mr Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline. Instead we have this mess, which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with Ali G except for the packaging.Terribly disappointing. Go seek out the DVD's of Innit, Aiiii, or Bling Bling for some real Ali G.",1
Miranda House,"As a fan of ""Da Ali G Show"" on HBO, I had high hopes for this film. I should have known better when it went straight to video.... and then none of my local video stores carried it! The problem with this film is it simply tries too hard. I did not not want to see the Ali G character in his home environment or running for parliament or saving England. In my opinion, the ""Ali G"" character only works when he is operating OUTSIDE his environment --- so we can laugh at how unbelievably stupid he is and laugh even harder at the frustrated, often angry reaction his sincere stupidity arouses in all those unfortunate to encounter him. This movie bombs horribly due to the throwaway script, and as a result, it is an interminable exercise in sheer boredom with maybe 3-4 genuine laughs to be had in TOTAL. I well and truly HATED it from frame one and it just NEVER got any better (despite crossing my fingers and gritting my teeth). I think Sascha Baron Cohen has talent (his TV show proves it), but this movie shows absolutely NONE of that talent.",1
Miranda House,"Sacha Baron Cohen is clearly a talented comedian. He is able to completely sink into the most ridiculous and obscene characters and completely break boundaries that most films only push lightly. Shock humor barely begins to describe Cohen's style. But while ""Borat"" was hysterical because it unashamedly tore apart parts of American culture that we'd rather not think about, ""Ali G Indahouse"" doesn't quite cut it.Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a wannabe gangsta rapper who loves teaching kids at a community center about the gangsta lifestyle, but the center is losing money and is going to close. He goes to London to go on a hunger strike in protest, but at the same time, the Chancellor is planning on double-crossing the Prime Minister to get his job. To that end, he needs to have the Prime Minister hire a young, ""in touch,"" person to fill a seat in Parliament, who will then fail and force the Prime Minister to resign. The chancellor sees Ali G, and immediately selects him for the role of the unknowing pawn. Needless to say, things don't go as planned.""Ali G Indahouse"" is a satire. It spoofs the public's concession about what is acceptable behavior in today's world while also making fun of politicians who despite showering the public with words and promises, are so clueless about what the people really want that they fail. The film allows Cohen to do what he does best, which is to act outrageously in places and situations where behavior must be kept under strict control. Yet, despite there being a few hilarious sequences, the film doesn't really work.Perhaps the reason why this film doesn't work is that there's actually a plot. In ""Borat,"" Cohen let the character run wild and that was it. Here, Ali G is given a storyline, and maybe the film could have been better if the story was decent (which it isn't), but it closes the walls on the character, and Cohen's characters need as much room to breathe as possible.I've seen a few clips of Ali G, and he's just not as funny as Borat (I haven't seen ""Bruno""). True, he can get us to laugh, but he's just an moron, instead of a man who is so clueless that he doesn't realize that his behavior is appalling, bordering on illegal. ""Borat"" was funny because only Cohen and the filmmakers were in on the joke. ""Ali G Indahouse"" doesn't have that luxury.The humor is very British, so if that's not your thing, it's another reason to skip this one.",3
Miranda House,"This is actually a quite lame comedy with some extremely childish humor but it all still somewhat works out due to the presence of the legendary Ali G character in it all.Even though this movie has basically nothing to do with the ""Da Ali G Show"" the character still works out as well in this movie. It's of course a ridicules and outrageous character but he's all the more hilarious because of it. It's obviously a satire on the whole rap and hip hop scene and it's still Sacha Baron Cohen most legendary character, despite the successes he has had with Borat and Brno.The movie has some very childish humor, which mostly is about sex and it has an almost non-existent story. It's just the kind of movie in which the story really doesn't matter. It's all purely about the main character. Even the lamest and most predictable movie in this movie will still surely make you laugh a couple of times. ""Ali G Indahouse"" is not the most hilarious movie ever made or the best thing Sacha Baron Cohen has done in his life but it's good enough for a couple of dumb silly laughs. Still the movie gives you the feeling it has more misses than hits in it but jokes are bombarded at you so fast that you just tend to sort of forget the movie its weaker moments and enjoy the movie its more funny moments.Quite amazing actually that respected actors such as Michael Gambon and Charles Dance appeared in this type of movie. Or perhaps they knew of Ali G's success and just wanted to be a part of it. Still I feel that when looking back at it they won't regard this as their finest moment.Good enough for a couple of dumb laughs.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",3
Miranda House,"Funny movie story about the successful character created by Sacha Baron Cohen who in his interviews succeeded in bursting the pomposity of many an unknowing victim. Unfortunately, after a while everyone knew who he was and the element of surprise was lost. A movie seems a logical progression.When news of the movie was first leaked, people speculated as to what the story would be. It would involve Staines that much was clear, so it was interesting to see Ali becoming the MP for Staines.It's a sign of how well the character is regarded when one considers the calibre of the actors involved. Hats off especially to Charles Dance, particularly for dressing up in the short leather skirt at the end.Since I live in Staines it was interesting trying to spot the many familiar places and also the changes in the town since the movie was filmed. In fact it is said that this movie was responsible for the rejuvenation that the town seems to be undergoing.For the most part the movie delivers it's laughs, although personally I've always found Cohen's other character, Borat, painful rather than funny. Still this is only a small gripe.If you watch carefully in some of the scenes you can see building work in the background. This was the new Staines cinema, and on the day it opened I saw this movie there.In summary, an amusing movie debut for a great character.",0
Miranda House,"Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type  of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over. I'm actually going to buy this on DVD when I find it.",5
Miranda House,"This is an extremely funny movie i had a blast of laughters, sacha is one of the few pillars in the comedy world he innovated new kind of comedy, chiefely sarcastic and racist but no hard feelings because people need to understand that this is new genre of comedy that where his originality come from picking up on countries, people and even things, he mastered this character of Ali G you will see how naturally talented he is in this role .",5
Miranda House,"Ali G is undoubtedly an important character in terms of entertainment. He's a fictional gangster rapper, created and played by Sacha Baron Cohen and was used in short sketches in order to trick unwitting celebrities into giving interviews. And everything about the set-up worked, perfectly. However, when something is designed for 'small bursts' there's sometimes some problems when it's transferred to a full-length movie in terms of story. Here is an example of a film that just about pulls it off. Just.I quite enjoyed 'Ali G Indahouse,' but then I'm a big fan of the series (and I wasn't expecting too much!). However, I can't see the film attracting too many new converts, or really appealing to a wider audience. Gone are the clever interviews the character was known for, plus any real attempts at poking fun at popular culture or social commentary. Now, all that is replaced by a pretty generic story about Ali G trying to save his local youth centre by running for Parliament and getting used by political heavyweights in order to try and appeal to the youth of today.There's nothing particularly inspiring about the story and it's all wrapped up in plenty of pretty unsubtle 'toilet' humour (or at least that of the s3xual kind!). What was once a cutting attempt at poking fun of those too stupid or embarrassed to say what's literally staring them in the face has become one 'body-part' joke after the next.The supporting cast are there for Ali G to play off, including an underused Martin Freeman (before he was mega famous!) and acting greats Charles Dance and Michael Gambon (playing those dastardly 'suits' in power), but it's Sacha Baron Cohen's show all the way. He really does put his all into the role and certainly isn't afraid to send himself up, looking the fool at every given opportunity.And it's this kind of commitment that saves the film. Even as a fan of the original (sketch-based) creation of Ali G, I wasn't too sure about the full length film. Luckily, it's not too long and, although completely predictable, is certainly watchable enough if you're not offended by the language and subject material. It's definitely not 'high brow,' but I feel there should be a place for films which aren't supposed to tax you mentally after a day's work. Here, you can just put your brain on hold and smirk at the silliness on screen.I enjoyed it at the time and I still do today. However, I do feel that Cohen's future (big screen) releases were much 'sharper' in terms of taking a character developed for TV sketches and turning it into a feature-length movie. If you like Cohen's work, you should definitely check out his later offerings 'Borat' and 'Bruno.' Maybe 'Ali G Indahouse' was effectively Cohen honing his art? But, if you're still unsure as whether to watch or not, maybe just look up an old Ali G sketch on YouTube and, if you like it, you may just like the big screen version, too.",4
Miranda House,"For some reason Sasha Baron Cohen delivers an incredible performance in TV shows that make you laugh. Yet, the moment the same story goes to the big screen it becomes almost idiotic. Ali G Indahouse is the first of those attempts and the weakest of them all, preceding Borat and Brno.What you've seen in Da Ali G Show is more or less translated to the cinema format, but there is one important thing missing. A rather strong socio-political message underlined the TV show, in particular the season(s) filmed in the US. None of this is to be found in Ali G Indahouse. The movie resembled Scrubs with adult jokes in a feature film.",2
Miranda House,"Well alongside his fame and fortune Sacha Baron Cohen has also managed to achieve such a high level of notoriety with his urban character, that the actual town of Staines changed its name to Staines-upon-Thames to get away from the negativity. That's pretty impressive Mr Cohen, you made an English town change its historic name, is that funny?.Like many TV characters that have reached the big screen this whole thing feels padded out, forced and struggling for material. Unfortunately this is no different despite being a brilliant and popular creation by Cohen. I think it was a bad choice to go down the actual movie with a plot route as we all know this character like all of Cohen's characters works better when lampooning reality. Seeing the highly naive and thick Ali G trying to strike a conversation with a real politician about current affairs only for him to lower the tone and go off on completely random filthy tangent is what its all about. Hearing Ali comment on his bitch 'Julie' or his various friends from Staines and the things they get up too is amusing to listen too, but to actually now see these people spoils the myth as it were.Of course the biggest draw with Ali G is the highly accurate satirical mocking of young British teens (black and white) who imitate the American rapper gang culture. This is the crux of his laughs, his not so secret weapon, talking with this modern day slang cum multicultural cockney hip-hop dialect that is frankly cringeworthy to listen too when anyone speaks with it, especially white folk. Add to that his heavily Jamaican/Afro American/UK chav influenced streetwise attire with bling, tracksuits and big trainers and you have a great controversial character ready for upset public figures.Thing is all of this is completely lost in the film because there is none of that, its just a silly bland plot about Ali trying to save a community centre in Staines. There are no funny clever stinging moments because its a scripted movie, instead they must rely on childish toilet humour which only works part of the time, its immediately unoriginal and loses all credibility. Coupled with the fact the cast is made up of big names merely sinks this project even further, big names equals no risks, no proper laughs, no awkwardness or embarrassing moments, its all played safe which is not what Cohen and his creations are about.Now I would be lying if I said there were no funny moments in this film, there aren't many but they are there. For me personally the best and most recognisable lampooning of my home country would be at the start of the film when Ali is 'street racing' in his hyper modded Renault down the high street. This very short sequence is extremely amusing because of the stringent UK road laws and the fact we have to drive at 20-30mph everywhere. Watching these two uber modded cars crawl down the high street at 30...pulling up sharply at the 20mph speed board is hilarious, literately the best bit in the film.Its actually reasonably funny during the start of the film whilst Ali is within his home territory of Staines and his mates. After that as we follow him to Westminster it just loses any fresh comedy hopes and becomes so derivative, the character of Ali G does grow somewhat but only in the wrong way. Instead of the chavy boorish dunderhead we all know and love we end up with some Americanised superfly looking pimp that just feels too much of a stretch even for this character. We all know about the typical UK traits that Ali G represents, we all roll our eyes at the image he portrays because we all see it in our daily lives, that's why its so funny. If you take that away and go down another countries cultural route then your target audience won't relate to it anymore, simple as that.In the end this film has just gone too far over the top with the character and its just not funny. Had it been a mockumentary style flick like 'Borat' then it would have worked I'm sure, but this option doesn't. Its basically puerile with dated stupid visuals gags and must resort to showing Charles Dance in drag to try and raise a laugh, and it fails at that. Such a huge huge error for the direction of this film that has resulted in a very very average outcome.4/10",2
Miranda House,"Sacha Baren Cohen has created a masterpiece that will be loved by audiences all across the globe! The film has some great one liners that will keep you laughing until it hurts. I have the film on DVD and have watched it at least 10 times, and it never seems to get old! It is quite cringe-worthy in some places but that's what makes ALI G so lovable and this film so brilliant. This is outlined in how it grossed over 10 times its budget and the music in this movie is just brilliant too! This, along with Borat are Sacha's best works and he deserves all the credit that comes his way. The girls aren't have bad in the movie and the films all round display should be admired!",0
Howla Howla,"A year after their classic comedy series, ""I Dream of Jeannie"" , left the air, stars Barbara Eden & Larry Hagman made this wonderful TV movie in 1971. After five years, Liza Crocker ( Eden ) returns to the small town that her family founded generations ago--Stainesville, out west in Nevada. She has come out here because she is seeking a divorce from her husband, Eddie ( Hagman ), back in New York. When she reaches Stainesville, she finds that old friends she grew up with have a mysteriously hostile attitude toward her, and old acquaintances are even worse. She drives up to the Stainesville Lodge where her step-mother, Rose ( Vera Miles )greets her. Rose introduces Liza to her new step-brother, Justin ( John Rubenstein ). Liza is very anxious to see her archeologist father, but , as Rose puts it, ""He's down in Mexico poking through those ruins of his. We had no idea you were coming."" Shortly after Liza's arrival, she learns that a little girl had been murdered in the town recently and the girl's body had been thrown in the lake. A stray dog can be heard howling in the woods. There is a bizarre double-murder / conspiracy that has occurred in Stainesville, and the locals are determined to keep a lid on things forever. Only Rose seems to be aware that, now that Liza has returned, it is only a question of time before the entire truth comes out. Eddie has followed Liza to Stainesville because he does not wish to lose her. ""A Howling in the Woods"" was filmed entirely in and around beautiful Lake Tahoe, Nevada and features excellent performances from a wonderful cast. The audience can't help but root for Barbara Eden's character ( the former 'Jeannie' is extremely gripping here ! ). The viewer gets bits & pieces of relevant information all through the film, but the suspense never really let's up right until the very end. This is one of the finest TV movies of the early 1970s and it sometimes is shown in the late evening on a local station. You should set your VCR to tape this one if you can. A marvelous and very well written mystery / thriller that could rival even a similar theatrical film shown today, ""A Howling in the Woods"" is a small screen cinematic triumph that should not go ignored...if you can help it!",0
Howla Howla,"Starring I Dream of Jeannies titular Barbara Eden and Larry ""JR"" Hagman A Howling in the Woods isn't what I expected at all. It was a pick and mix movie so I didn't know what to expect but based on the title I assumed horror and likely werewolf.Well it's not a horror and no wolves were or otherwise are to be found. Instead it's a thriller about a woman returning to small town America to see her father but being met with a very unpleasant welcome from a town with a dark secret.It's a slow burner but that works to its favour, what doesn't sadly is the movies weak structure and instantly forgettable characters.Does everything come together in the end? Yep. Is the revelation interesting? Absolutely. But the film itself is badly flawed and though watchable is something I feel could and maybe should have been considerably better.The Good:Some good ideasThe Bad:Poorly structuredThings I Learnt From This Movie:I am in no way saddened that I missed out on telegrams",2
Howla Howla,"A year after the cancellation of ""I Dream of Jeannie"", Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman reteamed for this made-for-TV movie that was as different from their series as night and day! It seems Ms. Eden is coming back to the house she grew up in to the surprise of her stepmother (Vera Miles) and new stepbrother (John Rubinstein). There's also a little girl (Lisa Gerritsen) who mentions another one her age who drowned in a nearby river. Not to mention a howling dog constantly bellowing...There's more but I don't want to spoil anymore of what happens. I will, however, mention that Hagman plays Ms. Eden's husband who's trying to reconcile with her after she abruptly left. Also, future ""Cagney & Lacey"" star Tyne Daly also makes a pivotal appearance. The suspense builds with each new revelation which is to the credit of director Daniel Petrie. So on that note, I recommend A Howling in the Woods.",4
Howla Howla,"After Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman's success in ""I Dream Of Genie,"" they wanted to work in dramatic films and TV.

Her soon-to-be ex-husband (Hagman), arrives, angering Eden. However, after a hostile reception from the townspeople, she's glad to have him along. As they piece the clues together, they mystery comes to a harrowing conclusion. Do yourself a favor: If this film is ever broadcast in your area, watch it. Or better yet, set your VCR or DVD player to record, and record this wonderful film. I did. And, I occasionally take it off of the shelf, duct it off, and play it. The only question I have is, what is that wonderful piano music that John Rubenstein is playing throughout the film? If anyone knows, my email is phillipgowens1@hotmail.com Thanks.",5
Howla Howla,"Most of the made-for-TV movies of the early '70s were junk.  ""A Howling in the Woods"" is the one glorious exception, and should have been released to theatres.  Two eerie plots eventually converge in an expertly plotted thriller.  Always underrated as an actress, Barbara Eden is superb as the lady-in-distress who indeed, while staying in a remote rural locale, is literally jolted by the nocturnal sounds of a ""howling in the woods.""  This nifty, scarifying thriller is always two steps ahead of the viewer in it's deliciously intricate plot turns and twists.  Expertly directed by Daniel Petrie.  A forgotten jewel, long overdue for restoration and a cable-TV or theatrical release.  Utterly terrifying, and Miss Eden, never more breathtakingly beautiful and vulnerable, is at her peak.  Forget ""I Dream of Jeannie"".  Instead check out and shiver through this spellbinding mystery-suspense-thriller classic!",5

I highly recommend ""A Howling In The Woods"" to Barbara Eden & Larry Hagman fans, or anyone who likes a good thriller. There have been a lot of cheesy TV movies throughout the past 35 or so years, but in my opinion this one was perfect in every way --casting, setting, plot, everything. 10 stars for one of the best made-for-TV movies of all time.",5

Howla Howla,"I remember seeing this movie on TV in 1971 while in the 10th grade in high school and it was pretty good. [Most of the TV movies of that era were shown from 9:30 PM to 11:00 PM (EST) so they were only 1-hour-and-30-minutes in length, but this one was a full-two-hours!] I missed the ending because I had a paper route to deliver at 4:00 the next morning (actually, 2 of them) so I had to go to bed. Anyway, what I remember is: Barbara Eden inherits this old hotel when her uncle dies. Disheartened with her marriage, she goes to stay at the hotel with the idea of remodeling and then running it. Shortly after she arrives, the townspeople tell her to leave and at night, she hears a dog mournfully howling in the nearby woods. As she tries to solve the mystery of the howling dog, she was told that a six-year-old girl was found ""accidentally drownded"" in the nearby lake. [She was told this by the dead girl's six-year-old cousin Betsey (Lisa Gerritsen).] As Eden's character investigates the howling dog and the ""accidental drowning,"" of the little girl, she become convinced that the two incidents are related.     It was about this point I had to go to bed so I could deliver the newspapers to my customers on my paper routes, so I don't know how the movie ends up. It would be really great if this movie were to be released on home video, so I could see the ending. I recently found a copy of the paperback novel on which this movie was based, so I know how the novel comes out, but I'd still like to see the movie so I can see how it comes out. (I suppose it is similar to the ending in the novel.) Anyway, I'm willing to pay whatever the price is for a VHS or DVD, so home video companies, here's your chance to make some more money off of me! How about it?",4
Howla Howla,A woman (Barbara Eden) returns home to a past and a town that doesn't really want her back.  A howling in the woods brings this chilling past back to her.  Larry Hagman plays a small part in this movie as her husband. A very good story and a hair raising atmosphere.,5
Howla Howla,"*NO REAL SPOILERS HERE, JUST A FEW HINTS*
This is an OK movie, but I don't think it's the ""classic thriller,"" that everyone else is raving about. A woman, played by Barbara Eden, who is getting divorced, returns to her childhood home, to see her father & stepmother. When she arrives, her father has left early for his yearly sabbatical. He didn't tell her he was leaving early, or where he could be reached. The stepmother (played by Vera Miles) is very glad to see her, and they have a good relationship. All the town's folk, who she grew up with, are treating her with disrespect. It is the same every where she goes. She cannot get an explanation for this, and she questions their motives. After all, these are people she's known since childhood, and she's always had pleasant relationships with them. Finally, a little girl, who's been watching her, shares some information. The young girl's friend, was found dead in the lake recently. When Barbara Eden questions her further about this, a man yells for her, and she runs off, afraid.Meanwhile, her estranged husband (played by Larry Hagman) has decided to follow her, and win her back. There is no real explanation as to why she left him in the first place. He seems like an amiable enough fellow, and it's clear he loves her very much. There is also a constant howling in the forest. It is the howling of a starving dog. This bothered me. Animals are only placed in movies as plot devices to suffer and die. They always meet a terrible fate, and this movie is no different. It really bothered me that the dog died. There was no reason for it to, there was no real reason to even have a dog in the story, much less to have it killed, but they did. Barbara Eden asks about the dog, and the town's people tell her to ignore it. She asks to buy meat for it, at first they refuse. But a local woman (played by Tyne Daly) convinces them there is no harm in letting her feed it. It is starving after all, why let it suffer? Tyne Daly seems to want to talk to Barbara Eden alone, but it will have to wait till after she goes to find the dog. She does, and when she tries to feed it, it leads her to a grave. She immediately goes to the police, and they are nonplussed. They placate her, and tell her not to worry about it. It was probably just something the dog had buried, but they promise to check it out. As soon as she leaves, they go and shoot the dog. It is a stupid, useless plot device that goes nowhere. She could have stumbled over the grave on the old path she was using to walk home. The dog and the howling had nothing to do with the story, and quite frankly was annoying. Tyne Daly finally tells Barbara Eden part of the story. She tells her about the dead girl, that she didn't drown, but was murdered.She also tells her about the man in the grave. She begs Barbara Eden to give her a thousand dollars so she can leave town. Barbara Eden agrees, and when she returns w/the money, someone has beaten Tyne Daly to keep her quiet. Tyne Daly gives a standout performance here, one of the best in the whole movie. Her character was the only authentic thing in the whole movie. I believe she is who she says she is, and I don't really with anyone else. From here it just gets weird. I won't ruin the movie with any more spoilers. I will say that if you're watching this because you want to see Barbara Eden & Larry Hagman interact, you'll be disappointed. I doubt they're on screen together for more than 5 minutes. The showdown at the end left me scratching my head. If the people involved are willing to commit one murder to cover their secrets, why not just commit another? The motives of the people involved are questionable. The relationships didn't make sense, the murders didn't make sense, and the lies would have been easily found out. I also don't know why the townsfolk were being mean to Barbara Eden. It was supposed to create mystery, but in the end, you realize there was no real reason for it. This isn't a bad movie, it's just not a good one. If you like Barbara Eden or Tyne Daly, than give it a watch, but otherwise, give it a pass.",3
Howla Howla,"Back in the 1970s and 80s, Barbara Eden starred in about two dozen made for TV movies. In most of the ones I've seen, she played a lovely woman hunted or haunted by something or someone...and ""A Howling in the Woods"" is no different. While it's not nearly as good as her classic ""The Stranger Within"" (where she was impregnated by aliens!!), the mood of this 1971 film is quite nice...it's just a shame the script wasn't worked out better.Eden plays Liza, a woman who's just left her husband* and has gone home to see her family who lives out in the country (it was filmed at lovely Lake Tahoe). However, despite being gone for years, she is not greeted as an old friend but with a strange coldness...and in a few cases, downright unfriendliness. In fact, throughout the film the only person that is really nice to you is the husband--who actually seems like a swell guy. Additionally, Liza's father is supposedly gone to Mexico...leaving Liza's step-mother behind. But this story makes little sense and Liza starts to wonder what the secret is that the town is hiding (it turns out to be two, actually) and what happened to her father.Throughout all this, there is a great sense of foreboding--something these made for ABC films really did well. Sure, the song they kept repeating throughout the story (it's apparently by Bach) is great, but it was repeated too often--the only problem with the otherwise creepy mood. Otherwise, the viewer is kept on the edge of their seat watching and waiting and waiting.Now this comes to the mysteries. They are NOT so good because in both cases there needs to be a very lengthy exposition by folks to ultimately explain them instead of letting the truth unfold more naturally. This is actually pretty sloppy...and disappointing. Still, the movie is a decent time-passer and a great excuse to see the lovely Barbara Eden in action once again. Worth seeing but certainly not a must-see.*By the way, I loved seeing Larry Hagman cast as Eden's husband in the film- --and I kept expected Eden to call him 'master' or try to grant his every wish or hear the ""I Dream of Jeannie"" theme!",3
Howla Howla,"Wealthy New York woman travels back to her hometown in Nevada to get a divorce, shows up unannounced at the lodge run by her oddly absent father and edgy stepmother; nobody seems to want her there, including the townspeople, who hold a grudge against her father for closing down the local mine. Made-for-TV mystery is top-heavy with melodramatic plot and burdened with exposition-filled dialogue. Richard De Roy's teleplay, adapted from Velda Johnston's book, is stilted and disappointing--he doesn't have a sharp instinct for the way familiar people speak to one another--however, the Lake Tahoe locations add atmosphere and both Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman give interesting performances as the squabbling marrieds. Also good is Lisa Gerritsen, one of the finest child actors of the era, as a youngster who knows the town's secrets.",3

Hmm. She stays with her very odd step mother and creepy step brother, Justin who she meets for the first time. She befriends a little girl that tells her about the death of her cousin, who was the other girl from the very beginning scene. For some reason everyone doesn't like to talk about it. The howling in the woods comes from a stray dog. Liza wants to help the poor dog, and discovers something sinister in the woods.

Howla Howla,"This movie is a golden nugget of made for TV thriller films! I figured I would like the movie for a couple of reasons: Eden and Hagman (loved them in ""I Dream of Jeannie"") and it was an old thriller. But I never expected the movie to be so good! I figured it would be better than so-so but less than great - yet I find it to be in the great mystery movie category! If you can ever find a copy of this movie then you should view it - rent or buy it if you have to. The movie is for those that love older films and exciting thrillers! Lovers of old horror and mystery films may like this movie too.A good late-at-night film to enjoy! You will forget all about I Dream of Jeannie when you get engrossed in this movie.9/10",5
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,"A year after their classic comedy series, ""I Dream of Jeannie"" , left the air, stars Barbara Eden & Larry Hagman made this wonderful TV movie in 1971. After five years, Liza Crocker ( Eden ) returns to the small town that her family founded generations ago--Stainesville, out west in Nevada. She has come out here because she is seeking a divorce from her husband, Eddie ( Hagman ), back in New York. When she reaches Stainesville, she finds that old friends she grew up with have a mysteriously hostile attitude toward her, and old acquaintances are even worse. She drives up to the Stainesville Lodge where her step-mother, Rose ( Vera Miles )greets her. Rose introduces Liza to her new step-brother, Justin ( John Rubenstein ). Liza is very anxious to see her archeologist father, but , as Rose puts it, ""He's down in Mexico poking through those ruins of his. We had no idea you were coming."" Shortly after Liza's arrival, she learns that a little girl had been murdered in the town recently and the girl's body had been thrown in the lake. A stray dog can be heard howling in the woods. There is a bizarre double-murder / conspiracy that has occurred in Stainesville, and the locals are determined to keep a lid on things forever. Only Rose seems to be aware that, now that Liza has returned, it is only a question of time before the entire truth comes out. Eddie has followed Liza to Stainesville because he does not wish to lose her. ""A Howling in the Woods"" was filmed entirely in and around beautiful Lake Tahoe, Nevada and features excellent performances from a wonderful cast. The audience can't help but root for Barbara Eden's character ( the former 'Jeannie' is extremely gripping here ! ). The viewer gets bits & pieces of relevant information all through the film, but the suspense never really let's up right until the very end. This is one of the finest TV movies of the early 1970s and it sometimes is shown in the late evening on a local station. You should set your VCR to tape this one if you can. A marvelous and very well written mystery / thriller that could rival even a similar theatrical film shown today, ""A Howling in the Woods"" is a small screen cinematic triumph that should not go ignored...if you can help it!",0
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,"Starring I Dream of Jeannies titular Barbara Eden and Larry ""JR"" Hagman A Howling in the Woods isn't what I expected at all. It was a pick and mix movie so I didn't know what to expect but based on the title I assumed horror and likely werewolf.Well it's not a horror and no wolves were or otherwise are to be found. Instead it's a thriller about a woman returning to small town America to see her father but being met with a very unpleasant welcome from a town with a dark secret.It's a slow burner but that works to its favour, what doesn't sadly is the movies weak structure and instantly forgettable characters.Does everything come together in the end? Yep. Is the revelation interesting? Absolutely. But the film itself is badly flawed and though watchable is something I feel could and maybe should have been considerably better.The Good:Some good ideasThe Bad:Poorly structuredThings I Learnt From This Movie:I am in no way saddened that I missed out on telegrams",2
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,"A year after the cancellation of ""I Dream of Jeannie"", Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman reteamed for this made-for-TV movie that was as different from their series as night and day! It seems Ms. Eden is coming back to the house she grew up in to the surprise of her stepmother (Vera Miles) and new stepbrother (John Rubinstein). There's also a little girl (Lisa Gerritsen) who mentions another one her age who drowned in a nearby river. Not to mention a howling dog constantly bellowing...There's more but I don't want to spoil anymore of what happens. I will, however, mention that Hagman plays Ms. Eden's husband who's trying to reconcile with her after she abruptly left. Also, future ""Cagney & Lacey"" star Tyne Daly also makes a pivotal appearance. The suspense builds with each new revelation which is to the credit of director Daniel Petrie. So on that note, I recommend A Howling in the Woods.",4
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,"After Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman's success in ""I Dream Of Genie,"" they wanted to work in dramatic films and TV. Well, they exceeded beyond their wildest dreams and expectations in this film. A little girl was murdered and the local hotel owner (Eden's father) has suddenly left town. Her soon-to-be ex-husband (Hagman), arrives, angering Eden. However, after a hostile reception from the townspeople, she's glad to have him along. As they piece the clues together, they mystery comes to a harrowing conclusion. Do yourself a favor: If this film is ever broadcast in your area, watch it. Or better yet, set your VCR or DVD player to record, and record this wonderful film. I did. And, I occasionally take it off of the shelf, duct it off, and play it. The only question I have is, what is that wonderful piano music that John Rubenstein is playing throughout the film? If anyone knows, my email is phillipgowens1@hotmail.com Thanks.",5
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,"Most of the made-for-TV movies of the early '70s were junk.  ""A Howling in the Woods"" is the one glorious exception, and should have been released to theatres.  Two eerie plots eventually converge in an expertly plotted thriller.  Always underrated as an actress, Barbara Eden is superb as the lady-in-distress who indeed, while staying in a remote rural locale, is literally jolted by the nocturnal sounds of a ""howling in the woods.""  This nifty, scarifying thriller is always two steps ahead of the viewer in it's deliciously intricate plot turns and twists.  Expertly directed by Daniel Petrie.  A forgotten jewel, long overdue for restoration and a cable-TV or theatrical release.  Utterly terrifying, and Miss Eden, never more breathtakingly beautiful and vulnerable, is at her peak.  Forget ""I Dream of Jeannie"".  Instead check out and shiver through this spellbinding mystery-suspense-thriller classic!",5
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,"All I can say is that I LOVED it! It's always a pleasure seeing Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman working together after ""I Dream of Jeannie"" because their on-camera chemistry is perfect! This movie has several twists and turns, and towards the end it has you saying to yourself, ""Okay, WHAT just happened?!"" I highly recommend ""A Howling In The Woods"" to Barbara Eden & Larry Hagman fans, or anyone who likes a good thriller. There have been a lot of cheesy TV movies throughout the past 35 or so years, but in my opinion this one was perfect in every way --casting, setting, plot, everything. 10 stars for one of the best made-for-TV movies of all time.",5
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,"I was interested in this movie because I was a fan of Barbara Eden, and spent many vacations at Lake Tahoe.  To my delight, these only added to my enjoyment of a well executed thriller that kept me guessing until the very end.",5
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,"I remember seeing this movie on TV in 1971 while in the 10th grade in high school and it was pretty good. [Most of the TV movies of that era were shown from 9:30 PM to 11:00 PM (EST) so they were only 1-hour-and-30-minutes in length, but this one was a full-two-hours!] I missed the ending because I had a paper route to deliver at 4:00 the next morning (actually, 2 of them) so I had to go to bed. Anyway, what I remember is: Barbara Eden inherits this old hotel when her uncle dies. Disheartened with her marriage, she goes to stay at the hotel with the idea of remodeling and then running it. Shortly after she arrives, the townspeople tell her to leave and at night, she hears a dog mournfully howling in the nearby woods. As she tries to solve the mystery of the howling dog, she was told that a six-year-old girl was found ""accidentally drownded"" in the nearby lake. [She was told this by the dead girl's six-year-old cousin Betsey (Lisa Gerritsen).] As Eden's character investigates the howling dog and the ""accidental drowning,"" of the little girl, she become convinced that the two incidents are related.     It was about this point I had to go to bed so I could deliver the newspapers to my customers on my paper routes, so I don't know how the movie ends up. It would be really great if this movie were to be released on home video, so I could see the ending. I recently found a copy of the paperback novel on which this movie was based, so I know how the novel comes out, but I'd still like to see the movie so I can see how it comes out. (I suppose it is similar to the ending in the novel.) Anyway, I'm willing to pay whatever the price is for a VHS or DVD, so home video companies, here's your chance to make some more money off of me! How about it?",4
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,A woman (Barbara Eden) returns home to a past and a town that doesn't really want her back.  A howling in the woods brings this chilling past back to her.  Larry Hagman plays a small part in this movie as her husband. A very good story and a hair raising atmosphere.,5
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,"*NO REAL SPOILERS HERE, JUST A FEW HINTS*
This is an OK movie, but I don't think it's the ""classic thriller,"" that everyone else is raving about. A woman, played by Barbara Eden, who is getting divorced, returns to her childhood home, to see her father & stepmother. When she arrives, her father has left early for his yearly sabbatical. He didn't tell her he was leaving early, or where he could be reached. The stepmother (played by Vera Miles) is very glad to see her, and they have a good relationship. All the town's folk, who she grew up with, are treating her with disrespect. It is the same every where she goes. She cannot get an explanation for this, and she questions their motives. After all, these are people she's known since childhood, and she's always had pleasant relationships with them. Finally, a little girl, who's been watching her, shares some information. The young girl's friend, was found dead in the lake recently. When Barbara Eden questions her further about this, a man yells for her, and she runs off, afraid.Meanwhile, her estranged husband (played by Larry Hagman) has decided to follow her, and win her back. There is no real explanation as to why she left him in the first place. He seems like an amiable enough fellow, and it's clear he loves her very much. There is also a constant howling in the forest. It is the howling of a starving dog. This bothered me. Animals are only placed in movies as plot devices to suffer and die. They always meet a terrible fate, and this movie is no different. It really bothered me that the dog died. There was no reason for it to, there was no real reason to even have a dog in the story, much less to have it killed, but they did. Barbara Eden asks about the dog, and the town's people tell her to ignore it. She asks to buy meat for it, at first they refuse. But a local woman (played by Tyne Daly) convinces them there is no harm in letting her feed it. It is starving after all, why let it suffer? Tyne Daly seems to want to talk to Barbara Eden alone, but it will have to wait till after she goes to find the dog. She does, and when she tries to feed it, it leads her to a grave. She immediately goes to the police, and they are nonplussed. They placate her, and tell her not to worry about it. It was probably just something the dog had buried, but they promise to check it out. As soon as she leaves, they go and shoot the dog. It is a stupid, useless plot device that goes nowhere. She could have stumbled over the grave on the old path she was using to walk home. The dog and the howling had nothing to do with the story, and quite frankly was annoying. Tyne Daly finally tells Barbara Eden part of the story. She tells her about the dead girl, that she didn't drown, but was murdered.She also tells her about the man in the grave. She begs Barbara Eden to give her a thousand dollars so she can leave town. Barbara Eden agrees, and when she returns w/the money, someone has beaten Tyne Daly to keep her quiet. Tyne Daly gives a standout performance here, one of the best in the whole movie. Her character was the only authentic thing in the whole movie. I believe she is who she says she is, and I don't really with anyone else. From here it just gets weird. I won't ruin the movie with any more spoilers. I will say that if you're watching this because you want to see Barbara Eden & Larry Hagman interact, you'll be disappointed. I doubt they're on screen together for more than 5 minutes. The showdown at the end left me scratching my head. If the people involved are willing to commit one murder to cover their secrets, why not just commit another? The motives of the people involved are questionable. The relationships didn't make sense, the murders didn't make sense, and the lies would have been easily found out. I also don't know why the townsfolk were being mean to Barbara Eden. It was supposed to create mystery, but in the end, you realize there was no real reason for it. This isn't a bad movie, it's just not a good one. If you like Barbara Eden or Tyne Daly, than give it a watch, but otherwise, give it a pass.",3
Punarvasu Nakshathra Mithuna Rashi,"Back in the 1970s and 80s, Barbara Eden starred in about two dozen made for TV movies. In most of the ones I've seen, she played a lovely woman hunted or haunted by something or someone...and ""A Howling in the Woods"" is no different. While it's not nearly as good as her classic ""The Stranger Within"" (where she was impregnated by aliens!!), the mood of this 1971 film is quite nice...it's just a shame the script wasn't worked out better.Eden plays Liza, a woman who's just left her husband* and has gone home to see her family who lives out in the country (it was filmed at lovely Lake Tahoe). However, despite being gone for years, she is not greeted as an old friend but with a strange coldness...and in a few cases, downright unfriendliness. In fact, throughout the film the only person that is really nice to you is the husband--who actually seems like a swell guy. Additionally, Liza's father is supposedly gone to Mexico...leaving Liza's step-mother behind. But this story makes little sense and Liza starts to wonder what the secret is that the town is hiding (it turns out to be two, actually) and what happened to her father.Throughout all this, there is a great sense of foreboding--something these made for ABC films really did well. Sure, the song they kept repeating throughout the story (it's apparently by Bach) is great, but it was repeated too often--the only problem with the otherwise creepy mood. Otherwise, the viewer is kept on the edge of their seat watching and waiting and waiting.Now this comes to the mysteries. They are NOT so good because in both cases there needs to be a very lengthy exposition by folks to ultimately explain them instead of letting the truth unfold more naturally. This is actually pretty sloppy...and disappointing. Still, the movie is a decent time-passer and a great excuse to see the lovely Barbara Eden in action once again. Worth seeing but certainly not a must-see.*By the way, I loved seeing Larry Hagman cast as Eden's husband in the film- --and I kept expected Eden to call him 'master' or try to grant his every wish or hear the ""I Dream of Jeannie"" theme!",3

Vijayaratha ,"This movie is done in a different style than most of the movies in its genre. It works like a suspense thriller mixing elements of popular police and criminal drama , just that the criminals become some sort to police engaging in a witch hunt for the good guy who wrecked havoc on them , and the typical storyline of street gangsterism theme.Worth watching for the thrills it offers. Excellent cinematography and editing although it contains the typical romance scenes , it is not done awkwardly.Arun Kumar is back in shape after a long absence (since year 2000). it is rather shocking to see him in a totally different and updated role. And it is very suitably done in this film.",4
Vijayaratha ,"This movie is one of the finest gangster movie ever in Indian cinema. I never expect this kind of portrayal from the director Magizh. Hatoff to his excellent work. I rate this movie 9 out of 10. The reason I gave this highest rating is, this movie has a very unique portrayal about gangsters and also a common man's angry. and also you can not compare this movie to any other movies. someone compared this movie with Rowthiram. I have seen Rowthiram also. But this movie entirely different from Rowthiram. So this movie is incomparable. I wanted to rate top list of tamil cinema's gangster saga. I don't want to include Nayakan in this list because that was too incomparable.Top 4 list of Gangster movie in tamil cinema: 1.Aaranya Kandam -- 10/10 2.Thadayara thaakka -- 9/10 3.Polladhavan -- 6/10 4.Rowthiram -- 5/10I wanted to appreciate Arun Vijay for his great performance. Its not seems like he is acting, he just lived as Selva. Hatoff to you Arun Vijay. I became fan of you Arun Vijay",4
Vijayaratha ,"Just seen this movie with my friends after hearing good reviews from media and I am not disappointed.When the movie started it reminded me of Rowthiram and fortunately it don't after some time.The movie has a very good plot and some nice performance, especially from Arun vijay.Mamta got a meaty role in the film and has some nice romantic moments with Arun.The first half is really good.It will never bores you(expect for that item song).But what stops the movie from being best are average second half,some predictable and inconsistent with its scenes.oh well it can happens in this kind of complex plot.Magizh Thirumeni has done good job could have been better.Thaman has given a couple of soulful melodies.All in all job well done.Verdict:Worth its money.",4
Vijayaratha ,"movie has good plot ... nice characterization .. worth watching once.. if you wouldn't mind a item song (which is probaby added out of producer's compulsion :-P) the movie is worth watching once. Arun Vijay has done decent job .. Has acted like a normal guy next door... The romance is good between Arun Vijay and Mamta mohandas.. Good chemistry ... The acting and the screenplay also looked very good.. Cons are an unnecessary item song ... some audience might question the heroes power ... Real plus is casting & characterization, especially the villains ...The movie is much better than many other crappy movies we see these days ..",4

Chase,"I really enjoy this show, I don't care what the other reviews say! It's enjoyable, sure it's not anything life changing but it's fun enough, and keeps you guessing. The main characters are likable and you're always rooting for them. Sure there are some other cop shows out there like this, but give this one a shot! Kelli Giddish is great as Annie Frost, I like that this show has a very strong female lead! Cole Hauser is also good! and Jesse Metcalfe does well, I like seeing him in something that isn't like Desperate Housewives or John Tucker Must Die. Amaury Nolasco, and Rose Rollins really round out the team well.I really hope it doesn't get cancelled!!",5
Chase,"I disagree with all of the other reviews. Most people these days are just down right picky when it comes to their shows. This show is fun to watch. If you honestly enjoy having to watch shows like CSI where they have 10 different show pertaining to every city in the country and solving the same crimes, then by all means watch those shows.This show is very entertaining and moves at a quick pace.Most other cop shows on TV are very slow and the investigation portions tend to drag on.I think Chase is a very exciting show and I look forward to watching it every week.I hope that this show continues to make it beyond one season Hopefully this season continues to get better and starts to change peoples view of its quality.",5
Chase,"I love this actress! Annie Frost is not your run of the mill US Marshall diva who needs her makeup and hair done to a tee in every scene. Thank goodness Jerry Bruckheimer still casts women who have surprises under their sleeves.

And with Cole Hauser, Jessie Metcalfe, Rose Rollins, and Amaury Nolasco, and not to mention Kelli Giddish, I can't lose. I love the guest stars who really love to be bad and Chase has those guys. if I were an actor, and cast on this show I would want to be the bad guy,because Kelli Giddish would take me down. please give this show a chance to show it's true colors by exposing the soft side, and the dysfunctional side of the cast. I'm a true fan.",4
Chase,"I have to admit the show started a little slow. Now, my family is fully engaged. Great cast and good writing has been the key. I like the way the characters are now be coming more complex. Anne Frost is really becoming a charter with passion and heart. I am looking forward to the growth of this cast. Bottem line, the show is just fun to watch! With all the copy cat CSI 1,2,3, NCIS, NCIS LA, Etc, it is nice to add a little Texas twist. I also think it is nice to have a strong leading lady. One the comes across very down to earth without to much ego. My 11 year old likes this show as well and it is one the whole family can really get into.",5
Chase,My fifteen year old granddaughter came to live with me in New Hampshire last April. She moved here to New Hampshire from the Houston area so when we saw this series starting we set it up to record. And we were so glad we did as we loved this show. There are so many violent sexual shows on television these days that to find a good easy to watch and understand show was a breath of fresh air. We were very disappointed when we kept looking for it to return. It was a good family show that I could feel comfortable watching with my granddaughter and her cousins when they visit. We would love to have the network bring this show back. We miss Annie Frost!,5
Chase,"Really loving this show a lot!It's fast-paced and action-packed. The interactions within the team are also very interesting to watch.Personally I love the main character of Annie Frost. 6 episodes into the first season I can't wait to see the development of these elements :Annie and Jimmy's history; cause you can just tell they've known each other for a long time and there's something brooding. Is Annie going to hunt down her own ' fugitive' father? Luke and Daisy , how are they going to react after their one night together? What's Marco's story? Are we going to see more of Ben the Bountyhunter?Until now I've found every villain fascinating and the chase thrilling. They have had some of the best guest actors playing the villains. I hope this show is going to have a 'long' life on NBC (kinda worried about the low ratings but *fingers crossed*",5
Chase,"I must admit, the only reason I even noticed this show was Cole Hauser. Seeing his face flash across the screen caught my attention, and even then only for a moment. But when I noticed that the show was coming up after The Event, I opted to stick on for a while. The first episode was slow with little depth to the characters. I had a hard time learning the names, only remembering Annie and Jimmy. There was potential for humor, but the writers quickly dropped it and moved on. The bad guy was admittedly an interesting person. I do like how the show creates sympathy for the criminals as well as the victims. And the show did have a lot of action, which kept me awake enough to finish it. It also was enough to get me to turn it on again for the second episode.I'm glad I gave it a second chance. While there was still not a whole lot of character development, we did learn a little about our heroes. I'm still not sure on some of the names, but I did see the supporting characters more in this episode. There was more humor, though somewhat dry. And once again, the bad guy was the best and most developed character in the whole plot.You almost wanted to sympathize with him more than the good guys and the victims. The episode ended nicely, if somewhat predictable. The 2nd episode was decidedly better than the first. Hopefully, it will continue to improve.",5
Chase,"Before seeing this new show I read the reviews that weren't enthusiastic. I saw the cast list and, really, I didn't see anything that I could love at first sight. I'm also confident that not necessarily a great cast will make a show more enjoyable than any other but it helps. It helps a lot. For example if you watched The Forgotten (by CSI producer Jerry Bruckheimer and also producer of this show), maybe you could find Christian Slater as a reference but not much more than that, and it was a very good show. Or The Beast, with Patrick Swayze, and you could find another good surprise there. Good shows with many people not so famous, not so charismatic. And I think that in Chase you have some chance of finding some good moments. Maybe if the show goes well you can connect with the cast. That option lays on good stories for the future. The first one wasn't disappointing. Maybe not great as anybody of us would want to watch, but not disappointing. It's just standard and that's pretty OK. Let's see what happens next.",4
Chase,"My husband and I watched Chase every week; we looked forward to watching it! The show was exciting; it was a family show... no sex or graphic episodes. There is so much junk on TV and so many shows are full of sex. Many times the sex scenes add little to nothing to the story line. The story lines on Chase were easy to follow; the plot moved quickly; there were no dead spots in the show at all, and the characters were realistic. We also enjoyed the fact that Chase was set in Ft. Worth, Texas. Go Texas!!!!!When I could not find Chase on the TV schedule, I became upset; I have been looking for weeks for a way to let the makers of Chase know that we miss the show and want it to return. PLEASE end the hiatus and return Chase to TV.",5
Chase,"I getting so sick of the implausibility of a super female cop who can kick every monstrous evil psycho she runs across when in reality a person like that just doesn't exist and never will........that is probably why, although it is not my cup of tea, the closer is a much more realistic and far and away better show.........brains instead of brawn and if she needs brawn, they follow her around like a well oiled machine...........this show is, on the other hand, summed up in the title of my review...........i'm not even going to waste a lot more words describing how boring and formulaic this show is..........i'm sure it will not last very long anyway..........too bad they wasted their money on so many episodes.......they should have waited to see how it would go.",1
Chase,"Big waste of time. No heart, soul, or any entertainment value I could find. Kelli Giddish was so plastic they should replace her with a Barbie Doll. With a new leading lady it might have a shot but I deleted it from my TIVO during the first commercial. I suppose my biggest disappointment was I found the criminal making his guest appearance the most interesting character. I could not have cared less about the rest of the cast. The lead character Annie Frost left me cold. She runs, she jumps, she stares, but when she's called upon to speak it made me cringe. Her interaction with children was just painful to watch. I would expect this in a B or C rated movie but there are so many great characters on TV these days that I love or love to hate or at least like that I'm surprised they gave her the lead to a show that seemed to have some potential. Ms. Giddish might be fine in another format, maybe a Doctor that has few lines but I felt she brought this one to a stop on a dime halt.",1
Chase,"I'm a sucker for cop shows so its no surprise this showed up on my radar for the new season. Unfortunately, i am a little disappointed.The show itself is a little too formulaic; the badass female cop with a ~*super secret dark past*~ and Daddy issues, the new kid who's more square than Spongebob, etc., but it is only the first episode. Hopefully it will pick up over the season and it won't just end up being ""another boring cop show"".The lead female scowls a little too much for my liking, but i'm glad to see Amaury Nolasco every week :D I'll definitely watch the next few episodes, but i won't be devastated if i happen to miss it one week.",3
Chase,"I often am surprised when certain shows garner low votes on IMDb, as I definitely feel there are worse than Chase on television.One commentator added that she felt uncomfortable with many shows on TV due to the level of their sexual content. Sweet lord Americans, is this all you're worried about? After all, Marshall Annie Frost goes through Chase following the crimes of heinous individuals who sometimes shoot entire families (this is not necessarily shown, but is implied in cutaways). Meanwhile Annie tracks down the bad guys, and often, when possible... shoots them dead. So let us sum of the moral compass of this ""family show"" as another reviewer termed it. Bad guys sometimes do really bad things, so it's a good thing when they die, and even better if you can shoot them.I do feel the aims and intentionality of the show's protagonists are just, but to worry over the sexual content? Really? By the way, two members of the team are sleeping with each other, and the two main leads, Annie and Jimmy, are growing ever-closer to the detriment of Jimmy's already-strained marriage. So- yeah, no sex, just home-wreckers and morning-after scenes with fornicators. Point being, these are not detractors, per se, but they neither elevate, nor sink the real content; violence should be the truer issue of concern to persons with concern for moral issues. Troglodytes.",4
Chase,I really enjoyed this show. I Needed something to watch after I finished Justified and Longmire. This fit in nicely.,5
Chase,"I only want to see an buy the one episodes that Travis Fimmel is in,,",5
Chase,"I watched this because I had seen ""Blue Bloods"" the night before and this was the only choice that looked interesting. Big mistake. It was not interesting. The acting was wooden and the characters unbelievable. There did not even seem to be the expected amount of real police ""work"" going on. They just ran and drove and flew all over chasing the guy. Guess this is why it is called Chase.It only took a very few minutes to want to turn this off. Good thing I had laundry to do instead.The villain was the only really compelling character. The actress playing his daughter, Sissy, was also quite good.My recommendation - give this one a pass. Don't waste the space on your TIVO or PVR",2
Chase,"what a terrible show, lacking content, acting and smoothness. The show would rank amongst amateur or student film productions (actually, some students films are better). They obviously did not take the time or effort and seems likeed they rushed the screenplay to make a quick buck or two.This show is evidence that producers are lacking the creativity that the industry used to have, and now they have to ""borrow"" previous ideas (""ie. the fugitive). Granted some remakes or ""borrowed"" films/shows are far superior to their predecessor, but this is not the case here.Terrible, waste of time and I suggest you flip the channel.I give it a 1/10 rating and that is very generous.",1
Chase,"I try to watch this show to see locations I recognize, but it gets harder every week because there are so few actual ""good guys."" The criminals are scummy and violent, but the US Marshalls aren't much better. They're human enough with each other, but with everyone else, they come across as macho, arrogant, and too quick to use violence of their own. Annie Frost sometimes shows her human side with frightened witnesses or victims, but usually only after she's yelled unnecessarily and shoved her badge down too many throats. In Part 2 of ""Narco,"" Jimmy Godfrey and most of his team were too ready to ignore procedure and break laws to get what they want. And it was ironic to hear Marco Martinez use torture as an example of what made a particular drug lord evil when he was talking to a partner who'd just come from torturing that same drug lord to get information.Maybe this show appeals to the primitive people who endorse torture as a legitimate tool and who believe in the ""whatever it takes to get the job done"" approach to law enforcement, but those people should not be encouraged. A cop show doesn't work if the cops are just as corrupt as the people they're chasing.",2
Chase,"But only without the Annie Frost character. We quit watching because we simply could not stand her. The character acted like she was a one woman show and completely ignored her team's safety. She was constantly putting herself and her team in danger and acted like she knew it all, usually with results that could have resulted in someone being seriously injured. Not that it would have mattered if it had been her. If you watch a show, you want it to be realistic and her grandstanding was horrible. Also, that accent was so horrible and when she would look at a victim's relative and say ""I'll get the them"", we would laugh out loud. Never the team would find the perpetrator but always ""her"". What a joke. It just got to the point where we quit watching the show. The rest of the cast was superb and I think they should bring the show back without her and it would work. Make Jimmy the team leader and make the team work together like they do in other Jerry Bruckheimer shows.",0
Chase,"A few months ago, I decided to give this show a chance. I lost interest almost immediately and actually stopped watching after only five episodes, so my response may not be the most accurate description, for all I know, the show kicked up after those five episodes, but for me, it already was doomed to fail, and I was not in the least bit surprised when it was canceled. Now, I like procedurals, so my opinion isn't based on the idea that it should have been a more serialized drama. However, there are ways that procedurals can be good, but Chase had too many flaws for that to ever happen.Flaw #1: The plot structureThe structure itself was nice in that the show wasn't a 'whodunit' kind of show, rather it let you know exactly who was being hunted and even showed scenes with the villain throughout the entire show, which, I'll admit is a nice change from the norm. However, where this failed was the way the supposed villains were written. With the exception of two episodes, the villains were actually written in a good light. They were three dimensional characters thatwhile they did horrible thingsthey had a good heart in different ways. The episode that really brought this to light was the fifth episode, ""Above the Law."" By the end of the episode, I was actually annoyed with the Marshalls for arresting the bad guy. Actually, on more than one occasion, I felt like I was rooting for the bad guy to win, which is not really a tactic a crime procedural should take. Unless, of course the point of the show was to make the bad guys the real heroes of the show, in which case it did a pretty decent job at that.Flaw #2: Annie FrostAnnie was probably the least likable character on the show, and given the fact that she was actually the main character, that's not a good thing. But probably the biggest problems with Annie was that A.) she was unrealistically good and always seemed to manage to take down the bad guy single-handedly, but B.) She was too reckless. In one episode, for example, her team is in the middle of a shootout with an incredibly dangerous killer. She sees him stop to reload his weapon. Common sense tells me that what she should have done was tell her team to move in, guns drawn and ready to shoot, before he has the chance to finish. If he doesn't, shoot him. Nobody would miss him. But instead, she puts her gun away and charges him to duke it out. It was incredibly reckless and could have gotten herself killed, and in the long run, could very well get her team killed. That is not a character trait you want your lead character to have. And what makes the whole situation is that her partner calls her out on it. But instead of actually listening to him, she accuses him of planning to tell the team about her father, or some other bull crap, I honestly lost interest in that storyline relatively quickly (which is actually the third flaw). Despite the fact that he told her on numerous occasions that his problems weren't about her father and, in fact, about her death wish, she kept going back to her same argument, which just makes her even more unlikeable. It also brings us to;Flaw #3: Annie's father storylineThe difference between proceduralsand even character driven proceduralsand character dramas is that the fundamental plot of the procedural is to solve the case, whether it be finding a murderer or finding out what's wrong with a medical patient, while a character drama pretty much tells the story of the characters. As such, the dramas can shove a lot of back-story into the characters from the get go and get away with it, they are, after all, the main purpose to the story. With a crime procedural, the audience doesn't have to know everything about the character from the start, but it can be gradually included over time. We know who the characters are, what they do and how they act and as the story goes on, we get better acquainted with the whys: Why they do what they do and why they act the way they act, etc. But with Chase, Annie's back-story with her father is used as a subplot throughout just about every episode (at least the ones I saw) to the point that I didn't care anymore. I didn't know the character enough to be that invested in her back-story, and I didn't even like her enough to care about how bad it was. Quite honestly, the fact that the argument with her partner, Jimmy (played by Cole Hauser who was actually pretty likable in this show), somehow managed to revolve around her father just enforced my problems. It was like the show-runners wanted people to be aware of Annie's daddy issues and wanted us to sympathize with her, but in reality, it just made her look dumb. The whole plot line was so contrived and forced upon us. I actually tried to watch the sixth episode and ended up turning it off after five minutes and never turned it back on, strictly because of this plot point. Chase, I imagine could have worked, but these major flaws pretty much guaranteed that it wouldn't last.",1
Chase,"This woman don't know how to act, she must be used as a stunt. The male talking style is really boring. The whole concept of this series is stupid.I have seen better series being canceled, and the current TV is full of policial series Chase's concept must be reviewed by TV producers, its boring and there is no innovation at all. I mean how many police series are in the air lately? After CSI there are no good policial series in the air.Kelli Giddish character has no credibility, her ""badass"" attitude is to false.",1
Chase,"Annie Frost is an amazing cop. The things she does are amazing stunts. I can't imagine a single genuine cop doing any of the stunts she pulls. Giving orders to staff to jump and expecting them to leap at the snap of her command, like it would really happen. Talking about cases in public, waving guns around and more. She certainly is hot (maybe a bit scrawny) and can wear boots well, but come on, she ain't no Chuck Norris. The plot lines are totally predictable and rehashed from other shows. The technological feats are totally improbable. A US Marshall running around in a personal car that's a Cadillac? There are just too many stretches from reality.",2
Chase,"It has been 7 years and hundreds cop shows, and somehow I still remember this show.
The best part of this marshal show is the prey; I still remember most of fugitives, every villain in the show has unique story, and the show always add one scene to reveal there was some humanity left in the monster: The wanna-be-marshal caught two real criminals; the robber/killer let his daughter go; even the serial killer who pretended to be paralyzed showed mercy to the family he met in the woods...
I guess the lesson here is that it's impossible to create 20 different colorful villains per year, the show seemed run out of gas after 10 episodes, the villains became less interesting and the show got cancelled.",3
Chase,"US Marshalls track down fugitives. This is traditional police procedural. Good or bad... this is Kelli Giddish's show. She's driving this show. The most notable thing about her is her smaller stature. She doesn't look like somebody who can take down muscle bound criminals. Early on, she has a big fight with a fugitive. Parts of it just look staged. Luckily she has the cop mannerism down. Maybe that's why she'd get Law & Order: SVU later on. This also stars Cole Hauser and Jesse Metcalfe.The main problem was it never nailed down what the show should look like. It has Kelli Giddish as a tough cop lead and pretty face Jesse Metcalfe. It seems to suggest a light weight cop show, but then they put in all kinds of action. It's certainly not gritty enough to be serious. It needs to be better.",3
BaBo,"This movie was great! Lots of comedy, lots of emotional scenes, and the girls were cute. The story is also unique, its about sibling love as opposed to all the other romances about relationships and sex. Ha Ji-won was hot, as always. The dude from My Sassy Girl was also great, he played an idiot pretty convincingly, haha. The stories intertwined well together, and the ending didn't really upset either. The only gripe I had in this entire movie is how they dragged on some of the scenes. I know the fool liked to repeat stuff over and over again, but when the people of normal intelligence were doing it too, it seemed fake and over-dramatic. Overall a great film though.",5
BaBo,"BA:BO is a 2008 film based closely on a popular webcomic by Kang Full. While the film does contain some comedy, it tells a much deeper story than any of Cha Tae-hyun's other films. I would even say that the film is purely an emotional drama with only mere hints of romance and slight humor. In BA:BO, Ji-ho (Ha Ji-won) returns home after studying and playing the piano in Europe for over ten years. She left Europe because of the frustration that came with an instance of stage fright. Back in her hometown, she meets her mentally challenged, childhood friend, Seung-ryong (Cha Tae-hyun), who runs a small toast shop in order to take care of his younger sister, Ji-in (Park Ha-sun), who unfortunately despises him. Along with Seung-ryong's best friend, Sang-soo (Park Hee- soon), and Hee-yeong (Park Grina), the characters all suffer life problems of their own. It is the village idiot, Seung-ryong, who heals and saves them all.Ji-ho and Sang-soo's interaction with Seung-ryong evokes pity and nostalgic sympathy. Due to a misunderstanding, Sang-soo's guilt as a child drew him close to Seung-ryong as a true friend. Ji-ho on the other hand, was admired by Seung-ryong ever since they were little due to her piano playing that, according to Seung-ryong, would cause snow to fall and stars to appear. It is sweet and a bit sad to see Ha Ji-won's character treat Seung-ryong so nicely because of his innocent mind. While he genuinely likes her, she finds comfort and strength when she looks after him. The film tells a story that really can only be fully understood by reading the expressions and actions of the actors. And it is those actions that can cause the viewer to get a bit teary eyed here and there throughout the film.Speaking of actors, Cha Tae-hyun plays his role as the hardworking, village idiot so convincingly. And he does so with his own style  his signature goofy smile adds so much authenticity to his character's innocence. He really is one of the best actors in Korea. Ha Ji-won impressed me as well, considering that this is one of her first works that I've seen where she isn't type-casted as a cutesy love interest. The slight, emotional changes that her character experiences can be seen thanks to her superb acting, despite the limits that the script has for her character. All the other actors were great as well, besides Park Ha- sun in one scene towards the end of the film  while the scene evokes grievous emotion, it appears questionably forced.It is fascinating how the individual stories of each character seem separate, but all converge in the end. And it is that result that really makes the viewer sit back and think how people, no matter how smart or talented, can affect the lives and happiness of those nearby. BA:BO is a touching film that stays with the viewer well after the ending credits. I highly recommend giving it a watch, especially if you're a fan of Korean dramas.",4
Drive,"One reviewer here suggested that instead of seeing Drive you should see what Drive was aspiring to be Layer Cake. Drive is nothing like Layer Cake nor even tries to be. They have nothing in common, and the comment is just absurd. It is a far far better film though. From it's title sequence written in cursive pink (which a ton of idiots just did not get for some reason) to it's retro soundtrack. It is a picture perfect reflection of the films from the late 60's, 70's and 80's. If you have not seen films from this era (i do believe so many reviewers here have not) you will not entirely get this film.This is a man with no name film. Instead of horses and cowboys we get fast muscle cars and ruthless gangsters. Our hero is a man with no name. He is also a man of very few words that can break out into fits of extreme violence at any moment to protect those he cares about. We get no back story to our hero just like the Eastwood pictures, which makes the film even more effective. He is not your typical Vin Diesel blabbering idiot action hero. He is an old fashioned action hero. Too many here did not understand this, and decided this was bad acting/directing. It is far better to imagine what Gosslings character has done to arrive at this point, than to be shown in some cheesy flash back sequence. Albert Brooks (who is just fantastic as usual), Ron Pearlman, and Bryan Cranston all provide nice contrast to our quiet hero.Another reviewer here stated there was no explanation for the second car at the pawn shop. Well there was. I will not give it away here, but you will find the answer in the motel sequence. The violence has also been hated on here, but it is just part of the world he lives in. The fact that he can be just as cruel as the gangsters adds to the mystery of his character.Not one negative review is credible. Unless you were raised on Transformer and Fast and Furious pictures. Then I guess you would need more CG, louder music, and bad duologue so you could understand the film easier. Or maybe you just need more imaginary computerized cars doing spectacular things on screen to hold your attention. The fact is this is a fantastic film, filled with great performances, and some of the best chase sequences since bullet. Be smart see films that matter.",0
Drive,"'Drive' is a visceral and brilliantly executed vision of art-house action; possibly one of the greatest art-house films to have graced the screen. Nicolas Winding Refn has created a stylised neo-noir thriller that is simply stunning; full of glorified violence and stroking imagery. The soundtrack is amazing, fully reflecting the films mood, whilst attempting to create an atmospheric feel to accompany the gritty action. 'Drive' is a captivating mix of contemporary and retro aesthetics. A stylish and taut thriller that keeps the audience entertained from start to finish with breathtaking sequences, brutal violence and stunning cinematography, a modern masterpiece that has truly redefined the noir genre.",0
Drive,"You might hear one comparing this to a Tarantino film, but leave all worries at the door, this is an absorbing and tremendously unique piece of cinema from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn. The reason it works so exquisitely well is because the film grabs hold of you and takes you inside this often dark and dream-like LA setting. So, when the end of the film hits, you feel apart of this film, and it's there to stay.This film also offers a Ryan Gosling like you've never seen him, speaking only when necessary, with tension and fury in his eyes. He's silent, caring, and ridiculously tough. Every line is delivered perfectly and every gesture is natural.I saw this at the LA Film Festival on a mammoth screen with booming speakers. The music only makes this film more unique. It is catchy and synchronized perfectly with the TRULY beautiful cinematography.This film is the BEST of its genre. I honestly cannot compare it to any other film, for it is truly that different. ""Drive"" is already the best of the year, because I'm POSITIVE no other film will haunt and invade me quite like this film has. This is not just a classic for its genre, but a beautiful and bold classic in general.",5
Drive,"A truly beautiful and hypnotic film.I've seen the last few Nicholas Winding Refn films, and while I liked both Bronson and Valhalla Rising a lot, they were both ""difficult"" films, in that both structure, pacing and tone were bound to alienate some people, and of course they were both marketed as somewhat mainstream films while being anything but.Part of the irony of Refn's situation is that he makes films about ""Primal"" man- and these protagonists invariably commit acts of great violence on those around them. This violence puts his films into the genre categories that Hollywood recognises and promotes to the public, resulting in trailers for Refn movies that grossly misrepresent the sophistication of the actual film. In that way, Valhalla's intense, slow-burning and almost dialogue-free mythic exploration of our savage past can be repackaged as a ""Vlad the Viking goes to the New World"" action movie.Yet both Valhalla and Bronson were highly ""directed"" films, revealing a very strong hand in control of the material. And so, I was extremely curious to see what Refn would do with the material, and whether he would be able to rein in his sometimes obtrusive style in order to allow the story more room to breathe... I shouldn't have worried. I think the director has managed to balance a genuine artistry with the demands of the genre in a way that is rarely, if ever, achieved. I absolutely loved it. Just stay the hell away from the trailer, as it reveals far too much, and again, misrepresents the film's true ""feel"".Driver has a tone of wry amusement at everything around it, much like Gosling's half-smirk, pivoted on the toothpick perpetually in the corner of his mouth. Schmucky gangsters and mob clichs provide some laughs, but the heart of the film is Gosling's portrayal of the unnamed? main character and his sweet, underplayed romance with Mulligan and her young son. While an ethereal synthesizer-pop soundtrack provides an at-times tender,at-times mythic undercurrent, the car chases and action scenes, when they come, are tense, brutal and brief- far more Eastern Promises than The Transporter. Mulligan plays her character all trembly, wet-eyed, sweet and innocent and is swept away by Gosling's quiet strength and self-assured charm, while Gosling speaks little and remains a mystery to the end, though we never doubt his fundamentally good nature. The seasoned supporting cast are all very fun, except maybe for Kendricks who is relegated to a fairly irrelevant part. Of course, this is really Gosling's film, and he inhabits the character completely, turning what could be a straightforward Hollyood tough-guy role into a complex and contradictory character, self-confident and physical, yet clearly lonely and possessed with a certain peculiarity and stillness, almost reminiscent of De Niro's Travis Bickle.Visually the film is lush and gorgeous. Like Michael Mann, Refn and his cinematographer are able to instill LA with a sense of life and character that most directors just fail to do. Unlike Mann however, Refn opts for warm orange tones over Mann's hard blues, and in one particularly beautiful sequence the familiar LA clich of driving down the dry LA river is taken to an unexpectedly joyful conclusion. Despite its absolute craftsmanship, Driver is probably not for everybody, which makes me sad. People who prefer bald-headed muscle men slugging and wise-cracking their way into their wallets should of course stay away, as this bears very little resemblance to the standard Hollywood fare associated with the genre, and they might well be disappointed.But for me, Driver was sweet, surreal, mythic, tense, fun, hilarious, revolting, and surprising. See it because it will make you a better person.And so, 10 out of 10, because it deserves it.",5
Drive,"After a summer of cheap thrills, Drive delivers thrills on the cheap. With a budget Michael Bay might have allocated for a single effects sequence in Transformers 3, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made one of the best movies of the year. Following Bronson and Valhalla Rising, Refn crafts his most polished, commercial work yet, while retaining all the ambiguity and unbridled aggression of his tough-as-nails art house pictures.Bearing thematic resemblance to Darren Aronofsky's recent output, Drive is like Black Swan in overdrive. The film pins its headlights on the dark implications of unchecked obsession and good intentions gone haywire. That dangerous duality  humanity on the razor's edge of animal brutality  is played to unnerving perfection by Ryan Gosling.Rightly among the most reliable names on the Hollywood marquee, the star of Drive plays a crucible of a character. A friendly, fatherly figure to his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, he's decidedly less so when the two are threatened. A sort of oblique, ultraviolent superhero, the driver leaps to defend the innocent with bloody determination. If the first half of Drive plays as drama, the second is straight up revenge fare.Playing on the juxtaposition of calm and calamity, Refn keeps us on our toes throughout. Quiet moments stretch into suffocating silence, and the explosive violence that inevitably shatters it practically tears the frame in half. The audio is expertly mixed; you'll want to see Drive loud. From its roaring engines and visceral blows to its curt dialogue, the film is an altar to the power of great sound design.In truth, Drive isn't pervasively violent, though its most excruciatingly effective moments leave a memory trail like tire streaks on a sunbaked highway. At the heart of the story is a compelling, surprisingly tender romance. Carey Mulligan has proved herself a similarly reliable talent to Gosling, and has worked in recent years with the likes of Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, and Mark Romanek.Her fragile character's relationship with the driver is subtle and nuanced in a manner atypical of thriller convention. They're not family, they're not even sleeping together. Drive is not a sexy film. Refn fetishizes neither cars nor women; if The Fast and the Furious is the sleek exterior curves of an automobile, Drive is the greasy, undulating pistons. And it's utilitarian at a lean 100 minutes.The rest of the small cast also impresses. Albert Brooks plays against type as a cutthroat crime lord, and a note-perfect Ron Perlman plays his meathead partner. Bryan Cranston of TV's Breaking Bad has a small role too, as employer and confidant to Gosling's character. Their relationships shuffle as lines are drawn and redrawn, but none of them comes away unscathed by the film's end.Drive is either the explosive end to a lukewarm summer movie season or an early autumn adrenaline rush. In machismo, it far outpaces its hundred million dollar competition, leaving overwrought tales of lesser heroes like Thor and Green Lantern in the dust. Its troubled characters, and the bonds of desperation that link them, elevate the film above its genre trappings and shield it from disposable entertainment status.Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is an anomaly. It's like a 1200 horsepower hybrid. And it's one of the best movies of 2011.",0
Drive,"A haunting movie with a stilted atmosphere reminiscent of Mulholland Drive though in an altogether different genre. The pink credits beginning the movie and the music throughout are pure eighties and set an offbeat tone against the contemporary LA streets and skyline. Great character studies punctuated by violent action scenes keep the audience immersed in this blood bath of a movie. Some powerful performances, stylish direction and intricate plotting complete this strangely understated production. Drive may not deliver box office gold in the short term though will certainly be paying long term dividends as a reference point for future film noir writers, directors and fans.",0
Drive,"I think we all remember hearing about Ryan Gosling right after 'The Notebook' came out. Most men, including myself, neglected the man on his acting ability. It's not a good reason to not really appreciate an actor. But when it comes to romantic flicks like that, i'm not really keen on the subject, or it's actors for that matter. But film by film, this man is starting to impress the hell out of me. Now it's about time to see what kind of chops this man has when it comes to an action film.Believe me when i say this.......it is the coolest damn action flick i've seen in quiet some time. It's not your basic shoot em' picture. It has this slight 'noire' edge to it that makes it shine much brighter than the rest.For starters, let's talk about the pace of the film. Most may call it slow, whereas i call it hypnotic. The lead played by Gosling, is a cold and quiet fellow who barely even speaks, blinks, or give any reference to his emotions. The film is littered with these somewhat awkward pauses by his character........i personally wouldn't call them awkward, because the way the film is presented, it makes them look beautiful. Case in point......in the movie ""Heat"", you know how Dinero, Kilmer, Sizemore, Trejo barely speak to one another. But the overall feeling is just so entertaining to watch? That's the exact same feeling you get when you watch this picture.But as the film rolls on, Gosling's character becomes a bit more vibrant. And by that, i mean more gory. It's not the kind of gore you would expect. Not like Tarantino gore, but more like a David Cronenberg gore. (History of Violence, Eastern Promises). You know, the settle, yet explosive gore that you really weren't expecting......which i love. And then the movie does nothing but climb higher and higher with it's level of intensity. It took this stone cold character, and molded him into one cool ass superhero.But what really sold me on this film was it's overall FEEL. The best example i can give is this........it's a cool mix between ""Heat"" and ""Taxi Driver"", with a very artistic edge. I already said that the movie is hypnotic, and i cannot stress that enough. Once the picture starts, your eyes are literally glued to the screen. The cinematography is fantastic, the musical score is hip and awesome, and the acting is top notch. All these elements were executed to perfection.Bottom Line.......i may go and see this movie again. I rarely ever do that......THAT'S how awesome this was. It's an art-house action flick at it's finest. Both men and women will drool over this movie. If you get the chance, go and see this movie......you will never regret it.",5
Drive,"Wow!! Did I miss something here? The biggest drawback of this movie is the plot: it's barely believable and lacking in substance. While the soundtrack is very good, it also cannot save the weak dialogue which is mostly Ryan Gosling staring at people and things and not saying much at all -- we're supposed to think that's really cool. He also likes to wear that scorpion jacket even when it's been bloodied. Becoming best buddies with the neighbor's kid on the first try - really? And then willing to risk his life even after the neighbor's boyfriend comes back from prison even though she previously hit on him - really? Also, outsmarting a police helicopter in LA in the first chase scene - really?The whole movie has that whole trying really hard to be cool vibe but it's really not. Overall an extremely disappointing effort. This movie just barely makes it above the big B.",3
Drive,"I've been an IMDb member for about 5 years or so and I've rated over 650 titles. I never wrote a review before though...""Drive"" is the most overrated movie I have ever seen. When I got out of the cinema the other night I was outraged. But not in the ""I want my money back!"" or ""I want my two hours back!"" way. I was outraged because this movie is rated higher than ""Leon"", for example. I can name a hundred movies that are better than ""Drive"" but have lower ratings. In my opinion it's a 6/10 movie. Full of clichs, weak plot, no dialogue and uncalled for explicit violence scenes. The cinematic was good and the soundtrack was OK, but that doesn't add up. Everybody is talking about the acting. Well, what acting? There are no characters, not even one line of dialogue to be remembered. Ryan Gosling acts like he is the most awesome person in the universe. Moving around with his hands in his pockets or with his arms crossed on his chest, with a toothpick in his mouth like he's Stallone in ""Cobra"". A man of few words but who looks smarter than anybody else. He is ridiculous taking himself so seriously. But hey, he is a mechanic, part time stunt driver, part time get-away driver. How cool is that? Maybe he should have also applied for a school bus driver position so his sensitive side appear more clear to us and soften our dull old hearts.And what's with all that violence? Broken skulls, throats cut, blood everywhere all of a sudden. These scenes just don't fit in the movie. It seems that they were added just to shock the audience and to impress the 12 year-old who managed to get tickets. And don't get me started on the screenplay flaws...Anyway, there are so many things that I didn't like in this movie that they wouldn't fit in 10 reviews. I believe though that his rating will eventually go down. I mean, 8.7? Lets have some sense. That's how ""Matrix"", ""The usual suspects"" or ""Forrest Gump"" are rated... ""Drive"" is just a ""B"" movie and doesn't deserve to share the spot with any other film above. Unless, the world turns upside down.EDIT: OK, I was a bit out of line regarding the title of my review. It's just a highly overrated movie.",3
Drive,"Drive is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and adapted to screenplay by Hossein Amini from the novel of the same name written by James Sallis. It stars Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. Music is by Cliff Martinez and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Driver (Gosling) has a day job, he's a Hollywood stunt man, but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity. Into his life comes married next door neighbour Irene (Mulligan) and her little boy Benicio (Kaden Leos), pitching him right into the middle of two wars; one is for his emotional worth, the other with the criminal underworld.Real human being, and a real hero.They cheered at Cannes, it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise, Drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011. Some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables, meaning it wouldn't take much for something like Drive to find a favourable audience. Yet Drive is a special movie, the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests. There would have been many disappointed that it didn't turn out to be something akin to The Fast & The Furious 19, but as its reputation grows, one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by Refn's western done out in 1980s neo noir attire.Yes, at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings, where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion, could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture. But the material is in excellent hands, with Refn, Sigel, Gosling and co, calmly unravelling Amini's stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable that's laced with ethereal overtones. A picture where a look means more than any words can express, a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling, and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence, yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence, beating a mighty heart in the process.Propelling the picture forward is the complexity of Gosling's driver character. He has no back story for us to work from, and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with Irene and child. He is actually one of many purposeful grey areas (or should that be gris areas?) within the plot structure. We learn just enough to be on his side, a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent, he be Shane for a modern pot boiling Los Angeles. Helps, too, that he's so cool behind the wheel, where he mines Steve McQueen's effortless charisma. Refn delivers magic moments of car play, from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence, to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit, when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalin.Gosling is amazing, instantly iconic, soft voice matching his soft blue eyes, toothpick perched between teeth, it's a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory. It's with the calm moments that he triumphs most, be it watching TV with the boy Benicio or just gazing intensely into Irene's eyes, Gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance. Mulligan, too, is wonderful, deftly underplaying Irene to work off of Gosling to create heart aching tenderness, their chemistry superb. Isaac does fine work with the ex-con/husband character that is thankfully not stereotypical, Brooks is Colm Meaney like, thriving on simmering badness, while Cranston puts real heart into the role of Driver's garage boss, the closest thing the Driver has to a pal. The only one dimensional character lands in Perlman's court, but Perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the character's oafness.From the opening pink neon credits, accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack (a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days), it's evident that Refn is a man who takes his style serious. Drive is full of classy (yes arty) passages, fluid camera movements, single takes, non central framing of characters, slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted L.A., the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story. He of course is aided considerably by his editor Matthew Newman, and Sigel's photography. The former is dealing in seamless precision, the latter a master of shades (a lift sequence is to, ahem, die for) and colour toning delights. Marking this out as a Blu-ray essential.You can name about ten films that Drive has been either likened too or put forward as an influence, and Refn's work here has been touted as an offspring created by Michael Mann, Walter Hill, William Friedkin and Sergio Leone (all viable and all actually high praise indeed). But rest assured, Drive is still fresh and exciting, the perfect movie package. Refn's masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011. 10/10",5
Drive,"Welcome to the first edition of Movie Math. Beware, I spoil the entire movie in this review. My sincerest apologies. First, I do not like to applaud mediocrity, even if it is well done mediocrity. I understand the underlying point of the movie, but it was really buried and I shouldn't be able to get to that point so quickly. The audience prefers to be led, not slapped into submission. It just stings less after you realize you paid $12 to be treated like an idiot. Second, I did love the neon pink script, the members only jacket and the 80's pop (which, alone, is awesome but seemed like a loud, annoying filler for scenes that had absolutely nothing going on). Combined, they seemed like an afterthought.The movie consists of about 30 minutes of good solid plot line stuffed with about 1.5 hours worth of pointless fluff (ex. the river scene, all the staring, the shots of watching TV, the random garage & test driving scenes) all meant to build character and inspire (or something). This failed completely because I actually connected more with Albert Brooks' & Bryan Cranston's characters. Both of whom had less airtime than the main characters.And plot line- wait, there isn't A plot line, there are several, terribly integrated plot lines. Think: The Notebook + Grindhouse + Steve Mcqueen + Tarantino. The narration was so clich it made me wince. Never, EVER, should narration take the place of integral character development.The love plot is absurd. She doesn't know Gosling, he's super creepy, says nothing and somehow she gets a warm/cozy vibe so she invites him over to hang out with her kid. And I thought the romance in Twilight was bad (-1 star simply because I was forced to write Twilight). The violence was eh. I've seen gory horror flicks integrate gratuitous violence into the story line better, and in a less in-your-face manner, so that was unimpressive and unimaginative(-1). Especially because, unless you're sadistic, no one actually enjoys watching someone get stabbed in the eye. As for the dialog, there isn't any, and the cars have fewer appearances than sentences. So this leads me to believe the title is meant to have more than one connotation. Warning: here is where I get all ""artsy"". The title, Drive, can be interpreted in two different ways: one being the more literal sense: someone that drives a car; the second alluding perseverance. If it is the second, then the Refn/Amini duo are sorely lacking all around and Mulligan desperately wants her kid to die quietly at the hands of an insane mechanic. There's some perseverance for you.That being said, I did not enjoy this movie. I do not require the Michael Bay effect to be entertained but please, do not treat me like a Teen wolf/Twilight moviegoer (-1 AGAIN). Long pauses do not develop character, especially when a blank affect is meant to be a representation of stoicism/wide-eyes and a mom-haircut represent vulnerability(-1 for being a giant stereotype). Even if those blank stares are backed up by a wicked soundtrack (hell yes, Chris Martinez, high five! +1)and excellent cinematography (it's already been done before but whatever: +1). However, I was constantly reminded of other movies while watching(Collateral, anyone? -1) and I was left feeling like someone (Gosling and Refn/Aminihad) watched far too many Steve Mcqueen movies. And then they attempted, quite literally, to copy the dynamics. Unfortunately, the entire team (and some of the audience)failed to realize that Mr. Mcqueen's movies were written FOR him and Mr. Gosling has not quite reached that level. So -1 for not being original. I was not impressed by Mr. Gosling's acting (What acting? It's so easy to stand around and chew a toothpick: -1) and I honestly do not understand all the hype regarding Ms. Mulligan. I've seen almost all her movies and she plays the doe-eyed victim with a giant heart in every. single. one.So -1 for typecasting. This also includes Christina Hendricks, by the way. She looked SO uncomfortable. Well, maybe that was the point, or maybe it was because her pants were too tight and she was robbing a pawn shop wearing 5"" heels. I should -1 for it being unrealistic, but this movie would then have a negative rating.Gosling and Mulligan attempt the profound ""say something by not saying anything at all"" (-1 for bad directing) but Mulligan appears dimwitted and Gosling goes from mimicking George Washington on the side of Mt. Rushmore to suddenly being a skilled fighter. I did not see that coming. Maybe that was yet another point?The stunt driver should be commended, though, he/she had some pretty tricks done with effortless flair (+ 1 for talent). So I tip my hat to you, sir/ma'am. Mustangs are not easy to do donuts in.I was bored an hour into the movie (-.5) and was squirming at the pretentiousness of the director by the second hour (-.5). That by itself says quite a bit seeing as I am an avid moviegoer and watch just about anything. May I reiterate that being reminded of others' work does not dredge feelings of nostalgia, it makes me want my $12 back. So, unless I didn't do my math correctly, I gave this movie a 3/10.",0
Drive,"At the Theater- ""Drive"" -- This is not an Action film, this is not a ""Car"" movie- It's a character-driven, slow-burn thriller of the first order that features elements of some of the finer works from Directorial royalty like Martin Scorsese, Michael Mann, William Friedkin, Quentin Tarantino, Walter Hill and the late Sam Peckinpah.The film is an electric mixture of beautiful, lingering cinematography, a pulsating soundtrack, lean dialogue and short bursts of graphic, bloody violence. It's tense and involving- almost impossible not to get immersed in. Nicolas Winding Refn is a Director to definitely keep a tab on.Ryan Gosling is the embodiment of some kind of cold fire at the heart of the matter- his ""Driver"" character is a well-intentioned but unstoppable force that will surely end up as a cult favorite for decades to come. Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks and Oscar Issac round out an excellent cast that's pretty much in support but extremely well-utilized.Those wanting to check out a quick and disposable, mindlessly fun popcorn flick need to steer clear- this isn't what you're looking for. This is deadly-serious film-making that's damned-near perfect.It's my favorite film of the year- Hell, it's one of my all-time top faves.9.5 outta 10",5
Drive,"I really tried to like this movie but honestly it was pretty strange. First of all there's no real story. I feel no connection to any of the characters or the acting. Gosling is this weird arrogant silent guy that we never learn much about. All the other characters are quite clich. The coincidence is also pretty strange that Gosling happened to live in the same floor as the guy he wants to help with money problems is actually in dirty business with the guy sponsoring Gosling. Plus the movie is called ""drive."" I expected to see little more stunts than just unrealistic and unnecessary handbrake spinning in only one scene. The filming and setting were the only good things about this movie. Not even the music was catchy. I feel like I've been have a strange plot less and lifeless dream while watching this movie. NO substance at all and strange acting i will rate this movie maximum a 6.8. I don't understand what the hype is and why people are going crazy about it. It really is something just to pass time let alone a masterpiece. As if everything mentioned wasn't bad enough the violence is just downright ridiculous and again unnecessary. Who is one second kiss a girl romantically and the next second bashing someones skull open. I don't even know what else to say, this is a movie i will remember for being slow and strange.",0
Drive,"Ryan Gosling brings down the hammer on that line where logic reason and self preservation become secondary to protecting what is important to you. There are a few moments where he doesn't just cross that line but obliterates it completely.Beautifully crafted pounding action thriller with twisted humor and seriously hard core violence. Compelling tenderness from characters that are unsophisticated in the best sense of the word.This film will go down as one of the best Action films in decades. Car chases that rival and extend beyond Bullitt and French Connection. Violence that bursts out of the screen like a horror film or a bad dream by David Cronenberg. Passing moments of tenderness that are drawn out until you are slowly pulled into the emotional world of the protagonists. Something so powerful, especially when it works, is the use of sharp and dramatic Camera Angles in Drive that mirror the emotional moment of the story drawing you into the characters world. View and angles often extremely low angled and tilted sharply upward, effective at expanding the feeling of voyeurism of being at the dinner table or in the adjacent seat, right in the room with the characters while safely looking up from some shadow or nook or cranny. Very emotionally transcendent cinematography. Night footage was amazingly successful at capturing the range of light and shadows, on a technical level the audio and video were strong and assured. Not only the first robbery but all the way through the film right up to the final resolution of the plot, the night was a familiar environment for major turns in the story (pun intended). I will return hopefully soon to expand on this review, but I had to write something tonight because this film is ten times more badass than any Transporter or Fast and Furious fare that is usually sold in their all too obvious packaging. Drive leaves them all in the Dust. This filmed was viewed on the Big Screen at the LAFILMFEST screening June 17th 2011",5
Drive,"Ryan Gosling plays a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as an escape car artist for local thugs. He gets involved in the life of his next door neighbor, her kid and the husband who owes money to the mafia boss Gosling's character happens to works for.The film plays out terribly as the murky and meager plot is all over the place and the pacing of the film so off, it just beggars belief. The many scenes just showing Gosling's blood stained clothes are so slow and stretched that you can see the changing of seasons in the background. And every time our hero starts to talk there's a standard 6 seconds delay before he actually starts to mutter his script lines. Pause in a conversation can add drama to the moment, but I shouldn't have to be tearing the hair from my cranium while watching it. Action sequences are few and far between and the story itself is done completely by the numbers; excavating only stereotypical behaviour and gratuitous violence from the flimsily drawn out characters. Think of a Tarantino movie you liked, then strip away the interesting characters, the music, the daring plot and sharp dialog. What is left is good cinematography and an incredibly cool choice of font for the end credits.I'm seriously left dumbfounded as to what prompts people to vote on this miserable excuse for entertainment with more than 6 stars. Perhaps it is the overall quality of films nowadays which seems to be in a hasty decline, rendering people clueless as to what rating to give to a film. But I can safely say that this project is as lifeless as it is artless and I would recommend the 1999 movie Ghost Dog in stead. A movie that shares many parallels with 'Drive' but which is made with far more authenticity, humor and overall class. Not to mention it having an actual silver lining and point to it.30/100",1
Drive,"This is an awful movie. Perhaps all the more so because there were the ever-so-slight hints that it might have been good.Watch the first half-hour. Gosling's (unnamed) character, when spoken to, takes ridiculously long pauses--upwards of 10 seconds--to respond.>>>Spoilers ahead The story is, um, flimsy. Porn-movie flimsy. There is a central crime to this story that never really IS explained very well (sure, it looked really cool when that other car showed up, but... wwwhy was it there, exactly?), and is really the product of a monumental coincidence. Think about it: Gosling just happens to be the driver for a holdup where his neighbor is robbing cash from a pawn shop in a heist that's really been masterminded by... the guy who's bankrolling his race car? Huh? (and, no, the story makes absolutely NO effort to explain this).As much as I love Ryan Gosling, he's just plain bad here. Maybe not ""just plain"" bad; spectacularly, pretentiously bad. I know what the creative intent was, that the character was just something of a ""blank canvas"" that others project their wants and needs on to. The biggest problem here is that Gosling can't tone down the smart and charming enough for us to believe that he's as socially isolated as his character really should be. And, again, he tends to try to substitute blankness for intensity. It doesn't work.Carey Mulligan is okay, but her character is pretty one-dimensional as well. I got zero chemistry off of the combo of her and Gosling. The kid is basically a prop. I'm sorry, I got absolutely nothing to say why this guy develops an attachment to these two.When Mulligan's husband appears, there's actually a little tension for a bit, and I began to hope for some substance (especially since he has considerably more chemistry with Mulligan than Gosling does). Sadly, ""Standard"" is killed off fairly quickly.There's no shortage of great performers in this movie, and they're mostly wasted. Ron Perlman is so awesomely menacing! And so completely under-written! And what's there is clichd! God, what were these people thinking? Bryan Cranston has a supporting role as Gosling's partner/boss. A huge opportunity is wasted when his character's interest in the stolen money is just casually discarded. That might have actually GONE somewhere. As a ""Breaking Bad"" fan, I know just how good he can be, but the writing here is nowhere near as good, and his character, as well, is left adrift.And Albert Brooks. Who I've loved since ""Lost in America"". It breaks my heart, because he's actually awesome in this movie. One of the most compelling cinematic criminals since Brando, I kid you not. Thoughtful, emotional, utterly believable, but since he's the only character that we develop even the remotest sympathy for, he's not quite enough to redeem this mess.I was hoping for some action, at least. And there really isn't much. For a movie about a driver, there honestly isn't that much driving. The movie opens with a not-bad robbery getaway, but there's only one more serious chase later on, and even IT isn't especially noteworthy. Did none of these people even WATCH ""Bullitt""? And, speaking of car action, there's one scene where Gosling's character repeatedly rams another car. Hard. Hard enough to send it rolling off a small cliff. And yet, afterwards, we see the front end of his car, seemingly undamaged. Are mid-70s Chevelle parts really that hard to come by? There are legitimate flashes of creativity in ""Drive"". There are some genuinely original scenes of violence (and, to be fair, well-executed). Had the story and characters risen to a level where the audience might have cared, well, this might have been a different movie.This is one of those ""emperor's-new-clothes"" things the movie industry pulls on the public every once in a while. Don't fall for it.",2
Drive,"It seems to be the case nowadays that film audiences, particularly at this time of year as the summer winds down, are left with a choice of seeing the latest broad appeal movies filling the multiplexes, or venturing to the local independent cinema in search of more intellectual fare. Very rarely will a film transcend these boundaries and offer a mix of Hollywood-style action and art-house flair, which is what makes Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive so unique and something to be celebrated.Drive tells the story of an unnamed stunt driver (Ryan Gosling) moonlighting as a getaway driver for a crime syndicate run by Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). Seemingly a loner, the driver becomes involved in the life of his neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos). After agreeing to drive for Irene's newly paroled husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), and finding himself on the wrong side of assassination contract, the driver embarks on a mission to protect Irene from the vicious gangsters who would seek to harm her to get at him. It's a well-worn plot line which in the hands of someone less adept than Refn would likely be nothing more than a forgettable thriller, yet the massively talented director, who picked up the Best Director prize at Cannes this year for Drive, crafts an engaging and thrilling throwback film elevated by masterful performances across the board.Refn, previously known for the fantastic Bronson, and the lesser known but equally excellent Pusher trilogy, is a man who has very clearly studied his Kubrick. Certainly most modern directors could do worse than imitate the style of one of history's greats like Stanley Kubrick, but rarely does one pull it off with the skill of Refn. In Bronson, the influence was a little more obvious, with the resulting film seeming like something of a spiritual successor to A Clockwork Orange. With Drive however, the traces are a little more subtle, visible in the impeccable technical touches, and the use of dissolves, pensive long takes, and slow zooms, a hallmark of Kubrick's catalogue. Drive is a flawlessly crafted film, filled with beautiful imagery of the Los Angeles underworld seen more often in the work of Michael Mann.The technical achievements of Drive are more than matched by the acting of the entire cast, and Refn shrewdly selects a wide variety of performers to populate the story. Top notch support comes from Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, the ever dependable Ron Perlman, and particularly Brooks, who jettisons his familiar comedic persona in a truly frightening and villainous performance, which will surely be on the radar of voters come awards season. Mulligan shows characteristic heart in a largely overlooked role, yet the film unquestionably belongs to Gosling. Often heralded as one of the finest actors of his generation, in Drive Gosling delivers his best work yet as the driver; a quiet role that is all the more effective due to the subtlety of the performance. He displays an ability to ratchet up the tension using just the slightest widening of his eyes and tensing of his jawline, and when the character is pushed to act more forcefully, Gosling transitions from almost silent observer to brutal aggressor so swiftly that it leaves one breathless. It's work that he makes look easy, yet it's the most focused performance seen in an action film in quite some time.There's something undeniably retro about Drive, with its neon opening titles and 80s infused soundtrack, but the film seems remarkably fresh. Smart action filmmaking is so hard to come by these days, so Drive delivers refreshing variety, beginning the time of year when the so-called prestige pictures are released with a bang.tinribs27.wordpress.com",5
Drive,"First the good: Drive is cast with excellent actors. Now for the bad. Based on this picture you would not know that most of the cast could act at all. Gosling's performance makes wooden seem lifelike. This must be due to direction because Gosling has been in several recent pictures and has acted up a storm in all of them. Gosling, Mulligan, Cranston, Brooks, and Hendricks are all interesting, accomplished actors. My question is: how did they get sucked into this horrible picture? Either the script that was shot was different from the script they read, or they had guns pointed at their heads.Every plot element of Drive was so unrealistic that I found it impossible to suspend belief. The characters are equally unbelievable. Less than an hour into the picture I knew how it would end. The only question was whether Gosling's character would survive, but by that point I didn't care. All the characters were too stupid to live. Violence has its place in film, but it is not a substitute for characters, a plot, and a story even when the stupid are getting their just deserts.Nothing in this picture hasn't been well done in other movies. Drive is derivative of Layer Cake, for example. If you want to see what Drive was trying to be, rent Layer Cake.",2
Drive,"I want my two hours back. I am convinced critics will only give a positive review if a movie is depressing and nihilistic. Don't believe the hype that this is some cinematic artistic achievement, when over 30 minutes of a two hour run time is filled with dead silence or overly long awkward pauses in dialogue , it's not ""hip and artistic"" it's just boring, nor is it ""stylish and clever"" when our main protagonist , who clearly has the upper hand at the end, defies common sense by putting himself needlessly in danger and not taking necessary precautions. I also don't find the retro 80s styling and soundtrack of a movie set in modern times to be ""artistic brilliance"" either, it's just distracting and awkward. Even our heroes' intentions seem to defy common sense,...risk your life for a girl you didn't even screw,a kid that's not yours, and her ex-con husband who doesn't even like you, that's not heroic, that's idiotic. If you want to be duped by critics who would have you believe this is ""stylish and clever neo noir"" go ahead and waste your time and money, but trust me ,once you dissect this movie for what it really is, it becomes a pointless exercise in nihilism whose plot points defy logic, common sense, and motivation, all glossed over by an over-stylized retro-80s feel and boring silence and self contemplation. Were there some good action sequences?, yes, but if you add them all up they take up about ten minutes of the run time. This one is a DVD rental at best, and by the way, if you saw this directors other film, ""Valhalla Rising"", even though the subject matter may seem completely different the theme and ending are basically exactly the same.",0
Drive,"In Los Angeles, a mysterious driver (Ryan Gosling) is a man of few words that works as a garage mechanic for his only friend Shannon (Bryan Cranston); stuntman in Hollywood films; and driver of getaway car in heists. One day, he helps his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), whose husband is in prison, and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos) and her falls in love with her. However, a few days later her husband Standard Gabriel (Oscar Isaac) is released from prison and they meet each other in the building. Standard is pressed by the criminal Cook (James Biberi) to rob a pawn shop to pay for the protection he had in prison, and the driver decides to help him driving the getaway car. However, the heist does not work as planned, Standard is murdered and the driver discovers that they have been double-crossed by Cook. Further, the money belongs to the Mafia and now he has to protect Irene and Benicio from the mobsters. ""Drive"" is a good thriller with the lead character without a name, recalling the style of Clint Eastwood in ""High Plains Drifter"" in the role of ""The Stranger""  a man that speaks a few words only, violent when necessary that protects innocent and beloved people. The film is weirdly attractive with potential of cult movie.The stylish cinematography discloses in an adequate pace the big picture and develops characters very well. The conclusion has an open end, a characteristic that has been forgotten by Hollywood. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Drive""",4
Drive,"When I started to get interested into film, I somehow started watching movie reviews on YouTube, and my favorite YouTube movie critic was and still is, Chris Stuckmann. After binge watching many of his videos, I found out that one of his favorite films is Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive. I decided to watch it one day, and I was very mixed on it at first. I then watched Chris Stuckmann's Analyzed video on Drive, but after that, I still didn't understand the movie too much. Then, one day, I just had the urge to watch it again. I don't know why, I just did, but watching it the 2nd time was a very mesmerizing experience. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting, and it's complex story makes Drive one of my favorite films of all time. Many people did not like this movie upon its release, and I think it is because of its misleading marketing. The trailers for Drive make it seems like the movie is a straight up action film with the utterly handsome Ryan Gosling in the leading role. The movie is actually a meticulously crafted neo-noir film that doesn't concentrate on the action, but on its complex story. This film is not only one of my favorite arthouse films, but one of my all time favorites.",5
Drive,"I'm not going to lie, before I saw this movie I thought Ryan Gosling was just another chick flick heart throb but damn my perception of him is blown.A movie so embedded with the style of classic film-noir and stylish new genre of art-house action. something that's rare in movies, though the plot is so plain, its what makes the movie fantastic, its not complex its not twist filled. May come off a little slow, but it catches you off guard, and that's what makes film great.Poetic yet violent, malnourished yet gruesome. Its a tribute to all those 80s action films with that retro feeling and cool vibe, a tale of a forbidden love and mafia heist. A protagonist which everyone can relate to, a man driven by nothing, a loner on a road with nothing and no one on it, though when something special comes along, his whole world changes.",5
Drive,"An hour and forty minutes of my life wasted. Never to be returned. The most pathetic excuse of a movie for a VERY long time!!!! Nothing happens. The most exciting part of the movie is... well nothing, that's the problem there isn't one. He doesn't even get the girl! It tries far too hard to be arty but misses out the important things like a story line! The pauses are too long, the dialogue from the main character borders on none existent and the music is peculiar to say the least! The irony of it is that the film is called Drive but contains very little in the way of driving excitement. Unfortunately life mirrors art in one characters line that he used to make movies, they called them European, cr*p in other words - Never a truer word spoken about this film!",0
Drive,"Seriously people, don't believe the ridiculous hype about this movie, it is without doubt one of the worst movies I have seen in the last year. My wife and I are huge movie fans and watch on average 5 new films a week, 10 minutes into this film we are both looking at each other with a 'is this movie for real' look on our faces, and by the end we realised we had just wasted 2 hours of our lives we would never get back again.Rylan Gosling is a total joke from start to finish, his total lack of any script is just the start, in fact by the end of the film (and yes we did make it to the end, somehow) I was glad he still wasn't saying much, and the little that did come from it was just clichd nonsense. This man cannot do the strong silent brooding type at all, especially not wearing a daft white satin jacket with, wait for it ..... a scorpion on the back, and a toothpick in his mouth.The plot, what there was of it, is so old and tired and so overdone, the whole film was completely predictable. None of the characters have any depth or interest to them, probably due to the lack of any script. Even Carey Mulligan, who is a real favourite of ours, was wasted and looked rather uncomfortable in her rather dull character - the single mum at home. And the clichs just continued at Ryan became the child's new 'best friend'.The violence is also completely at odds with the rest of the film. It is extreme, graphic and vicious, which is fine and dandy if the rest of the film demands it, unfortunately this film doesn't and it looks like it's been thrown in just for shock value.I really cannot understand why such a piece of second rate and boring drivel has got such amazing reviews on here and from some critics. Just before this we watched The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly again, now that has everything this movie doesn't but seems to be trying so hard to emulate - characters that aren't black and white, minimal dialogue to add to the tension, and stunning camera-work to keep you captivated.Save your time and money and watch this classic instead, Drive has nothing to offer but annoyance and the WORST soundtrack I've ever heard.",1
Drive,"Truly awful film. So awful that I joined up to IMDb so I could give it a rating and redress the ridiculously inflated rating this film has! It's the first time I've been completely let down by IMDb's points out of 10. I haven't seen all those films people mention from the 70s and 80's with a steely main man of few words and tough fists that apparently make this film so much more meaningful but who cares, you shouldn't have to have studied cinema to enjoy a film.So much gratuitous violence. Really, stabbing someone to death with a fork for I'm-not-quite-sure-what?? And was there any need for the jugular gyser? Disgusting, and none of the gore added anything to the film. Ohhhh so sh!t.There was minimal plot and no character development of anyone, and not enough background to make it all make sense. Nothing to explain why he developed such an attachment to the girl and kid, and then so ridiculous to think he'd stomp the guy's head apart to exploding when in the lift, in front of the girl that he loves, to protect her from a guy who just seemed to be there on a reconnaissance mission.",0
Dream Girl,"After seeing Skipped Parts, and reading all the user reviews, I see why so many are repelled by the movie, but I'm one of the ones fascinated by it. In order to care about a movie, I have to care about at least one character, and in this movie, it definitely was the case, with the Sam Callahan young male part. Although it's true that hardly anyone went through what Sam and his young girlfriend went through, it was captivating to me to see Sam want, so much, to be a real boyfriend to his rather matter-of-fact fellow sexual experimenter. I identified his caring for, and attraction to, girls, with my own young life. As for his mom's character:  yes, she was waaayy out there, but I have known women like that, so they *do* exist.  I think that, overall, Skipped Parts is one of those movies where you have to give in to the situation a little, and go with it. IF (and this is critical) you have been through at least some of the feelings, if not actual situations, these characters experience, I think you'll agree that the 93 minutes, or so, spent in their world is not wasted time (although I think one time was enough for me...too many other great movies out there to see!).",0
Dream Girl,"Just got back from watching the world premiere of this film at the Seattle International Film Festival.  I must say, I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  Skipped Parts is a wonder to behold -- outrageously funny, poignant and bold.  It never shies away from the tough subjects it covers while at the same time enlightening us with its humor.  The acting is top-drawer, Jennifer Jason Leigh is brilliant once again, with standout performances by  young Bug Hall and Mischa Barton. I don't want to give any of this one away, but I highly recommend you check it out.  A word of caution, if you find sexual banter and activity between 14-year-olds disturbing, do not see this film, it is not for the close-minded. Slated to be released in September 2000.",5
Dream Girl,"Jennifer Jason Leigh knows her stuff.  After picking up Skipped Parts off the shelf, my choice based solely on the interest in Jennifer Jason Leigh movies, I was not disappointed by Skipped Parts.  A coming of age story of the American family.  You can call it dysfunctional but through all of the problems and obstacles this family saw, it seemed to have more love and happiness than the stereotypical suburban, white picket fence family we are so used to seeing in every movie.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is spectacular, yet again, and anyone who loves off-beat movies with a heartwarming feeling from a different direction (compared to other movies) this is a must see and ace on my list.  Watch it twice then buy it (as I will do shortly)",0
Dream Girl,"I saw the trailer for this film a few times when I was renting some movies and I thought it looked very funny. Then today I saw it at the video store. I picked it up and watched it and loved it. I thought Jennifer Jason Leigh was so hilarious in this movie and she truly stood out as Lydia, Sam's mouthy, slutty mother. Another acting standout was Bug Hall, Mischa Barton and Angela Featherstone. I thought they played there part perfectly, especially the young leads and Leigh. I was also suprised to see Drew Barrymore in a very small role as ""Dream Girl"". Although it deals with pregnancy and sex with 14 year olds...I still found it very entertaining and if you want to see some very good acting and a good comedy, i recommend this movie very highly. 10/10",0
Dream Girl,"this is a quirky, entertaining flick. set against the backdrop of small town america 1963, it's a different 'coming of age' movie. goofy, drunken , obsessive adults and saner, wiser children attempt to sort through family roles and societal situations -- bigotry, sexual awakening, family structures, morality, abortion, gender roles --- this movie has got it all. it is, alternately,  funny, sad, depressing & invigorating, but always entertaining. a great rent!",0
Dream Girl,"I found this film to be a welcome relief from the self-righteous, hypocritical obsession with sex as evil in our confused society. I'm sure that viewers aligned with the extreme religious right are aghast at the sexual frankness of ""Skipped Parts"". I only wish they were as upset over the war in Iraq, America's obsession with violence and the rampant intolerance still pervading the home of the free. Instead, sex and four-letter words top the list of moral outrages in the minds of far too many of our number.""Skipped Parts"" is a compassionate view of outside-the-mainstream people at odds with the establishment. Granted, unprotected sex among teenagers is impractical and unwise, but hardly a reason to despise and condemn. Especially by those who have, as do some of the characters in the film, plenty of skeletons in their own closets.Well-written, well-acted and well-directed, ""Skipped Parts"" is a moral film in which the highest virtues are kindness, forgiveness, and love.",5
Dream Girl,"I just saw this movie at the Saint Louis International Film Festival. ""Skipped Parts"" represents one of those unusual situations where a movie comes across better than the book on which it is based. And the reason is even more unusual: I think the characters in the movie, especially the two young leads, are more real, more true to life than in the book. Unusual because printed narration should allow more time for character exploration. Sure, ""Skipped Parts"" is a comedy, but even humor gains when played out by people you care for. In the movie, the character of Maury, as portrayed by the fine young actor Mischa Barton, comes across a little nicer, and a little more sensitive to Sam's feelings than in the book. I like to think that Maury and Sam, while at first apparently attracted to each other by their brains - ""We're the only ones who can read,"" Sam explains - are actually more connected by their sensitivity to events in the world around them, as well as to each other. (Possible spoiler) Their moment of truth comes in the scene where Dothan roughs them up. By the way, even Brad Renfro's reading of the part of Dothan gives that character a warmth that's harder to find in the book, which in turn provides us with some reason to accept Maury's being his steady. Director Tamra Davis does an excellent job of bringing the story to life. She treated the characters and their feelings with respect. (Possible Spoiler) Particularly, I think she handled Maury and Sam's bedroom scene with delicacy and good taste, reflecting her sensitivity to and respect for the actors and the roles they played. You'd have to work very hard to be offended by it.It's a good movie with lots of good fun - interspersed with some deeply poignant moments - and it features some terrific acting turns by Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bug Hall, and Mischa Barton.",5
Dream Girl,"As a kid, every adult has had a time in his life that he or she was fascinated by the world of the grown-ups, but didn't know much about it. As an adolescent kid you want to know more about love and sex, but the path to adulthood can be a bumpy road. That's also the reason why there have been made so many coming of age-movies. Not all of them were very successful, but some of them sure are worth a watch, like for instance this ""Skipped Parts"".When in 1963, a young woman and her 14-year old son Sam from an unknown man, are expelled from North Carolina by her powerful father who runs for governor, they end up in a small town in Wyoming. Here she continues her irresponsible life of partying and having fun, while her son discovers that the biggest part of his new school is made up by retards who don't seem to know what a book looks like from the inside. There is especially one girl, called Maury, who he can't stand at first, but who he gradually starts to like more and more. When she asks him to help her experiment with sex, they get very close and with the help of his mother they get a pretty good idea of what sex is like. But despite the fact that his mother told them to stop as soon as Maury has had her first period, they are too late and pregnancy is the result. While facing the consequences of their experiments and with grandfather's dictatorial shadow over them, Sam and Maury get help from Hank Elkrunner, a Blackfoot Indian who has become Lydia's newest boyfriend...I guess that it needs some imagination to believe that all what is happening in this movie could actually be true. I'm not saying that it isn't possible, but sometimes it all feels a bit far-fetched. Nevertheless, this is still a very interesting movie and certainly one of the better coming of age-stories that I have ever seen. Especially thanks to the underlying story line of the double moral (sex outside marriage didn't exist, but abortion clinics were available, the totalitarian patriarch who wanted to keep his influence on his family, but didn't want them near him...) and the fine acting in this movie, this is a lot better than average. It's sure worth watching and I gave it a rating of 7/10 which is far from bad for this kind of movies.",4
Dream Girl,"I was watching this movie with my roommate on one of those i-have-nothing-better-to-do-evenings. I was really surprised to find out i actually liked this film. Other people have commented on this movie by saying it was to far fetched. But to be honest i don't get that. I know that this film is somewhat surreal, but reality isn't that far behind. I mean teen do get pregnant and when they lack good sex education (so to speak) they do experiment and pregnancy is the logical result. The film is sort of happy go lucky but it didn't bother me. I really liked the fact that it talked openly about pregnancy's among young people. I also thought it was rather sarcastic. Especially the last comment ""welcome to the modern American family"". I don't think that was serious but really sarcastic. I think it's save to say this movie was really cool. I recommend it to anyone who has an open view on such matters.",4
Dream Girl,"I just saw this movie about a week ago, although i am a girl who loves bug hall, i also enjoyed the ways that the movie portrayed life for younger adults in the 1960's. I admit that this movie had a severe consequence to their actions...but in those actions did those teenagers realize the responsibility, and dedication that they had to put forth to be happy. I'm sorry if i make no sense at all. It was a great learning experience for me, i was so awed at the way that Sam didn't want to end up like his father. From the start, he wanted for them to keep the baby. It was a GREAT movie, i give it a hundred and fifty out of ten.",0
Dream Girl,"It was one of the best movies I have ever seen, it just made me feel like I did when I was 14. It musn't be spoilt with more than 4 rows. It's just great!!! A must see movie for every one of you who wants to go back to his youth (if he ever had one)",5
Dream Girl,"This movie in my opinion had some very interesting twists, but I did not want my 7 yr old daughter to watch after I had seen it.  In the end, you get the sense that no matter how strange the family, or who makes up a ""family"", that anything is possible and that no matter how rough the situation, with a strong family and group of friends that you can get though anything.  This movie is one that Mothers and teen age daughters could watch together and both learn something about growing up.",0
Dream Girl,"""Skipped Parts"" is a watered-down version of Tim Sandlin's novel of the same name, the first in a wonderful trilogy about Sam Callahan's and Maury Pierce's unusual lives. I recommend reading the novel(s), where the two leads are 12, not 14, in the beginning and where the Wyoming landscape and Teton Mountains are just as much characters as they are a background for the movie.Not only is the story watered down and written for cheap laughs and tears, but the pacing is unbearably slow. Jennifer Jason Leigh is clearly not capable of doing justice to the methodically drunken Lydia Callahan, as her portrayal is really more of a caricature than a character; and Tim Sandlin sadly did little justice to his own novel in this screenplay by down-playing Sam Callahan's inner life as innocent, hopeful commentator on the action of the novel/movie. Much of his biting and insightful humor is lost by removing Sam's commentary.Read the book. It'll take more time, but feel hours shorter than this movie felt.",0
Dream Girl,"It's been almost a week since I saw this movie but I can't figure out whether it's view of the world is liberal or reactionary, libertarian or determinist. One of it's central themes is the importance of discussing sexuality with pubescents, one that the movie doesn't shirk from discussing openly itself but doesn't seem to advise others to do. Whether the movie is wilfully ambiguous and trying to start an honest debate on the issues it raises or just confused itself is a moot point. A previous comment indicates that the movie was slated for release in September 2000 but I think it may have been withheld until after the Presidential election in the US, as it's the sort of thing the ""moral majority"" seize upon as an example of Hollywood filth, though I found it deeply moralistic.I'm making this seem like a deeply serious movie, but actually it's main thrust is comic. It's got some excellent acting, particularly among the young members of the cast, and JJL is radiant as usual. Check it out, let me know what u think of it's moral stance if u want.",0
Dream Girl,"I ran across this quirky little film, and decided to take a chance on it because of the cast: Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Jason Lee, and Michael Greyeyes. I wasn't familiar with the younger actors, Misha Barton, Bug Hall, and Brad Renfro, but they do a great job in the film. Although some of the subject matter is a little uncomfortable, you laugh so much that it doesn't seem to matter. Basically what happens in this movie is that they address some serious life-changing subjects with a lot of humor in order to get their message (sex requires responsibility,etc.) across. At times, the kids seem more mature than the adults. Jennifer Jason Leigh is mind-boggling as the sexy, spoiled, southern single mom. Drew Barrymore's part is small, but she is memorable as a tantalizing temptress. Michael Greyeyes exudes strength and masculinity as a handsome Blackfoot rodeo cowboy. I would advise parents to watch the film before showing it to their kids. However, I also think it would be a good film to use in broaching the subject of sex and its consequences, etc. to family members entering puberty.",4
Dream Girl,"I was so amazed at how vapid and utterly ridiculous this film was that the first thing I did was search for substantial reviews.  It appears that the general thought was that if you don't think this is ""brilliant"" you must be a conservative crackpot.  The ""genius"" of this film appears to involve -""mature"" teenagers who are wiser than the adults around them (didn't we all know we knew everything at 16?) -Stilted and unnatural dialog -Cleche's about cliches (You are supposed to laugh at the fact that everyone in wyoming thinks everyone in the south is racist, ignoring the fact that it means that wyoming is just as prejudiced)Spoiler of sorts:I'd like to open by saying that I generally consider myself to be open minded.  The fact that the film deals with 14 year olds having sex isn't cause for the film to be chucked out the window (we all know it goes on). However, the fact that it suggests this is normal and healthy is strange. The closing line of ""The blonde, the indian, the cheerleader, and a 14 year old father - we are the new american family"" as if to suggest that this is a wonderous vision of the future is outrageous.Basically the characters don't comprehend or pay for the ramifications of their actions.  The girl remains a cheerleader, the boy continues writing, etc.  They touch briefly on the kids being ostracized by the town, but the implication is that they ""came around"".   The kids, although they are the least screwed up in the ""family"" (heck - the boy's mother taught them about sex and instructed them in what to do) doesnt mean that they have any concept of the consequences of their actions.  The film suggests that they are mature, but any sensible person knows what the passions of 14 are like versus the love of an adult.  I'm not saying that every film has to be a morality play, but this one seems to take itself way to seriously to the point of suggesting that this should be the definition of normalcy.This film really seems to have some kind of agenda on what should be acceptable. My .02, but as far as I'm concerned, this is 2 hours I'd love to have back.",0
Dream Girl,"""Skipped Parts"" is good, unusual, challenging ""small"" film about sex, relationships and growing up. I really enjoyed it and thought it was pretty brave of everyone involved. I'm having fun trying to work out who found it more controversial: the zealots supposed to hate it, or the liberals itching for the zealots to hate it. All I can say is, thank goodness for the internet, without which I'd never have heard about it or seen it.*spoilers from here* Jennifer Jason Leigh has a great vampy time as peroxided young Lydia, banished to Grovont (couldn't they spell Gros Ventre?) Wyoming from her Daddy's expensive Southern home with her illegitimate son Sam (as a punishment for her bad behaviour and for showing him up: Daddy's running for Governor). What starts as mere time in solitary becomes more interesting  for better and worse  for Lydia and Sam as they both meet their match. Maurey Pearce is one of the local kids ""who can read"" and is determined, with Sam's help, to know what are the ""skipped parts"" in all the books about love, marriage and sex. Hank Elkrunner is the Blackfeet cowboy whose steady persistence with the shiftless Lydia is finally rewarded. ""Skipped Parts"" may not be the most polished and definitive 'coming of age' type drama out there; but it wins my respect for many of the little details that set it apart from teenager and rom-com dross: the presence of Jennifer Jason Leigh, always a flag that something interesting's going on; the nice interaction between the two young leads, Bug Hall (Sam) and Mischa Barton (actually playing her age as Maurey); the quality of the cast, including Michael Greyeyes as Hank and Peggy Lipton as a pretty devastating Laurabel Pearce; the really fantastic sound, costumes, sets and locations. If you find the idea of underage sex unpalatable, well, I'm sorry for you. It's very much a reality, as any look at any tabloid newspaper in any given month will tell you. And it always was: what an outrageous lie it is, that teen and extra-marital pregnancy didn't occur in more repressed decades. For me this was as much the story of Lydia's growing up as it was of Sam's  in fact, more so. I found Lydia's story by the end of the film more believable than Sam's; she's so like a child herself - so unwilling to do more than play at the drama of life.Even I must admit that part of the ending did slightly jar on me. I live in a very liberal world: I've seen households made up of very unusual (and unexpectedly successful) combinations of people, and am only too happy with new, non-nuclear family images. But I wouldn't be altogether happy about a young teenager of my acquaintance watching this ending, and, perhaps, drawing the conclusion that if you leap backwards off a flight of steps there will always be someone there to catch you; because that simply isn't true. Conservative moment over. If you liked this film and want similar things, perhaps you'll be interested in the path I took to get here, which went something like this: Eric Schweig in the lovely modern fairytale ""Big Eden"". That film's director Thomas Bezucha, who also directed ""The Family Stone"", with its complicated modern family dynamics. Jennifer Jason Leigh, queen of unconventional roles (e.g. as Dorothy Parker and as Catherine Slocum, 'heroine' of ""Washington Square""). Michael Greyeyes, an accomplished plains Cree First Nations dancer who I'd thought was pretty impressive in TV historical romance ""Stolen Women, Captured Hearts"". Films about outcasts, others, the different, the lonely - try ""Trust"" by Hal Hartley; ""The Station Agent"" and ""Different for Girls"".",3
Dream Girl,"To best review this movie, it is improtant to review what happened in the movie.A 14-yr old boy has questions about sex, good, most do.  He has a nocturnal emissions and asks his mom what happened, ok, I'm sure he was scared, then his mom touches, then smells, then tastes, his emission.  That is about the level this movie is on.Within this movie two 14-yr olds have ""exploration"" sex.  Condoned, and instructed (by use of a taco shell), by the boy's mother and the girl's aunt.  The girl gets pregnant, the boy's mom drives her to an abortion clinic, there she sees her mom and history teacher so she leaves.
At the end of the movie the girl's mother is in an insane asylum.  Which is where the makers, and writer of this movie belong.  The girl moves in with the boy and his mother and her lover, with her baby.  The two 14-yr olds are shown as a happy couple raising a baby, he doing his writing, and she cheerleading. Sure, what about the endless crying baby?
The moral of this movie is how ""evil"" those conservatives are that say ""sex should wait"" and do evil things like force their kids to act right.  By doing what you want things may go bad, like being pregnant at 14, but things will always work out.",1
Dream Girl,"I thought the modern take on Romeo & Juliet in the Paul Sorvino/Lanie Kazan comedy 'Is Love All There Is' was the most ridiculous tale of young kids in love gone overboard that I had ever seen. That was, of course, until I watched Skipped Parts. Skipped Parts is the story of a 'bohemian' type of mother and son (at least by the rural Southwestern mid 60s standards) who basically turn their town's conventions upside down to a heavy degree. Lydia, a fantastic part played well by Jennifer Jason Leigh (it is a part reminiscent of her role as the punchy undercover journalist in 'The Hudsucker Proxy'), is kicked out of her North Carolina home where she lived with her overbearing, strict father in order to avoid embarrassment during his Senate campaign. Lydia is hanging by a thin string, already proved to be ill equipped to deal with responsibility. Thus, her teen son, is more of an equal, and an intelligent one to make up for the lack of parenting on Lydia's part.Together, they arrive in a small, 'proper' town in Wyoming, both hopelessly lost and terribly out of place, of course, given their nature. But this story and the two's effect on the town are more like an unfocused rebellion. That in the face of such staunch idiocy and conservatism by the town, Lydia and her son Sam (Bug Hall) are just going to to completely turn the town around, whether on purpose or by accident. With no direction, but just to rebel. The product is something even more out-of-wack than the small town was prior to their arrival, just in the opposite manner, so to speak. Sam befriends a pristine classmate, played by a very young Micha Barton. The two fourteen year olds develop more than just a 'show me yours and I'll show you mine' interest in sex. And with Lydia and her zany friend's encouragement, they do some experimenting. This is weird in the first place. Maybe not if we weren't such a sexual-conscious culture when it came to teenagers, but we are. Weird even for me. But, the two teenagers, who seem to like this experimentation, don't know when to give up, especially considering Lydia's warnings that once the girl gets her period, it's over. Well, I guess it's no surprise why this movie never hit mainstream release, or at least widespread mainstream release, considering the field day the religious right would have with this movie (and the book on which it's based?), with such young kids going for sex, and on top of everything else, a fourteen year old getting pregnant. And on top of that, keeping the baby. Meanwhile, we still see Sam as just a child. With his boyish fantasies about the movie star on screen and the like. How is it anyone thought they'd be capable of raising a child? How is it these kids thought so? The situation is taken way too lightly, and that's hard to get past.Other events in the town set off more chaos, possibly all started by the 'sex games' that Sam and his friend endure. But, that is more tolerable in mainstream American movies. The seemingly perfect wife having an affair and an abortion; the irresponsible mother being unable to commit and all of that. It's typical American fare, even in comedies. But somehow, I just can't get past how bizarre and how far things go between Sam and Maurey (Barton). It is an entirely strange, and more than not, an unbelievable situation. I think they went a little far with the intentions of showing how two 'liberated' people can have such a domino effect on such a tight-fisted town, for good or for worse.",0
Dream Girl,It's not a great movie but it's not as horrible as the reviews make it out to be. A comedy with a serious edge to it. Worth an evening.,0
Dream Girl,"I sat down and watched ""Skipped Parts"" and I found it to be pleasently surprising.  As I watched this, I came to realize you could insert this Southern family into any other rural area in the United States.  They are just as closed-minded as certain Southerners are now and then.  Even though suffers from a lack of a few thematic elements, it is well-written and acted out nicely.  Jennifer Jason Leigh had the best part in the movie as the skanky, partying mother.  Bug Hall and Mischa Barton did really well playing a pseudo-mature couple who have a child but both end up not together (that aspect is pretty horrifying).  Overall, I think is a pretty humorous and well-rounded look at what the consequences of sex can get you if you live in a small town in the 1960's.  I give it a 9 out of 10.I think the running joke in ""Skipped Parts"" is ""insert your own rural area here"".  Every little town in every state has those who are biased to outsiders regardless of the naivete they possess.  Here ends my rant!",5
Dream Girl,"There are just so many things wrong with this movie. It's not abstract enough to survive on story alone so the film maker did rely on the realistic points of the story. Unfortunately, there are none.This story wouldn't be considered normal by today's standards let alone 1963!! Two 14 year old ENCOURAGED to have sex by their parents. The girl gets pregnant like it's no big deal. She decides to stay with her boyfriend who doesn't seem to care about the fact that she's pregnant AND it's not his baby. Everyone is jumping for joy that she's having this baby... HELLO?!?!? She's 14!! I've NEVER seen anyone happy to have a baby at that age. Everyone that finds out about the baby acts like it's no big deal. In 1963, you would've been run out of town for being that way.Most of the story isn't fleshed out for the right reasons. Lydia's character is in almost every comedy/drama about the 50's/60's these days. The relationship between her and her son is pretty disgusting and just doesn't make sense. Whose Mom ever licked semen off her son's sock or bathed with her lover in front of her son. That'd get you locked up no matter what century you're in.I tried to get past these grotesque issues and focus on the characters and their stories but the only thing that makes this movie interesting is all the stuff I just mentioned. Unfortunately, that's the kind of comedy I'd look for in South Park, not some ""Sundance Classic"".1/10.",1
Rambo,"First Blood (1982) is a classic action movie that started all action genre one man army types action movies. It is my personal favorite movie of all time. I am a huge Rambo fan and I love John Rambo character. I love First Blood, Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rambo to death. I love them so much it is my favorite film series. I love First Blood to death this is my personal favorite action film. It is in my top 5 Stallone's favorite action films part 4 and 5 is Cliffhanger and Demolition Man. It is my personal favorite action film in the Rambo series. I love Rambo: First Blood Part II to death it is my number 1 favorite action film in the action genre. First Blood is my personal favorite action film of all time it is right up there with Part II. It is my number 3 favorite action in the Rambo series but I still love First Blood to death.This is my comic book hero this is my childhood movie the movie I grew up with it. This is the best movie ever my all time favorite action movie. It is the best of the best of all time. Sylvester Stallone co-write the script and started and the men can act, he is an action hero on screen in my opinion his best film. Yours is Rocky mine is Rambo action hero. I love Rambo's Survival Knife he rally's on his knife. ""I could have killed 'em all, I could've killed you. In town you're the law, out here it's me. Don't push it! Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe. Let it go. Let it go! ""First Blood is a realistic film portrayed about John Rambo a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam veteran who saw hell in the Vietnam War and he is hunted by the past. Sylvester Stallone plays the character of John Rambo very convincingly and Director Ted Kotcheff brings out the story to an effective scale allowing us to see the action through the character's eyes.. ""First Blood"" doesn't deal with CGI nor does it deal with special effects. It deals or tries to deal really hard on what is real. He feels that society is against him and he is angry. The movie has ton's of action, the motorcycle chases. Rambo climbs the wall of mountain and is been pursued by a helicopter and the police officer becomes the killer and try's to shoot Rambo with a riffle. Rambo jumps and hangs him self on the tree. That jump was for real and Sylvester Stallone really performed it. Rambo uses his martial arts to defend him self against abusive corrupt cops to escape. I love how the film shows Rambo trying to survive out in the woods while the guards are hunting him when in turn he is hunting them creating these traps putting these officers in painful situations. The best thing about ""First Blood"" is that we know that John Rambo was in the Vietnam War and was trained to kill, yet, he doesn't kill a single human in the film on purpose. John Rambo uses M60 machine gun and shoot up various stores in town including police station destroys the gun store and gas station. 
 
Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna both acted opposite Sylvester Stallone and they both acted well. Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle was excellent bad guy he performs his character well. Richard Crenna is Colonel Sam Trautman who trained and command Rambo in Vietnam for 3 years he is excellent as father figure to Rambo. ""First Blood"" is the best of the Rambo series mine personal favorite action film . The movie has beautiful music score from Jerry Goldsmith 10/10 Grade: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval My personal favorite action movie of all time.",5
Rambo,"Everything about this is brilliant. From Goldsmith's rousing score to Stallone's perfect performance. Yes, you heard me. Stallone does act in this movie. I feel so sorry for Rambo. People are real nasty to him. Especially the deputy with the moustache. He was a real jerk. The scene in which Rambo finally explodes in the jail cell is way cool. The music that goes with this scene is SO intense. I highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack. This is a proper movie by the way. I know that the character of Rambo became a 'little' exaggerated and silly in the sequels but do not let that alter your opinion of this movie.The Pacific Northwest scenery is also very beautiful and atmospheric. The sound design seems to be crafted so that dialogue sound natural like it would in a mountain forest or in dead cold environments where the air cannot carry sound so well.See this movie in widescreen to appreciate how cool it really is.",5
Rambo,"First Blood is simply one of the best films ever made. I think it transcends the action film genre and has stood the test of time. Stallone was immensely popular back in the 80's and if it is true that he hated the first cut of the film, then one can only say that he is lucky that he didn't get his wish to scrap the entire thing.John Rambo is first introduced to us as he is walking into a small town to look for a friend of his that he served in Vietnam with. Upon discovering that he contracted cancer coming back from the war, Rambo wanders aimlessly into town. He is greeted by a small town overzealous sheriff named Will Teasle, played wonderfully by Brian Denehy. He at first tells Rambo that he will help him out and give him a ride. When Rambo asks if he can find a good place to eat, Teasle directs him to a diner about 10 miles up the highway. Rambo asks if there is a law against him eating in the town, Teasle, says yea, me. This sets up the premise as Rambo begins walking back into town. Arrested for vagrancy, Rambo is taken to the local jail and we meet some of the local redneck officers, notably, a young David Caruso, who seems to be the only one who empathizes with Rambo. Finally, he escapes the jail and takes the entire small town sheriff department and the military on a hunt into the local ""jungle."" First Blood has strength of character. It has frenetic action scenes and every actor in the film is at the top of their game. Samuel Trautman, Rambo's mentor and former Colonel in the war, is played by Richard Crenna as a no nonsense but empathetic man. He knows Rambo has pushed back a little too hard but he understands where his plight comes from. He wants to avoid more bloodshed but at the same time he doesn't completely agree with how Rambo has been treated. He is obviously a law abiding citizen, but he knows that not all the laws were upheld when dealing with Rambo.Sylvester Stallone is RAMBO. There is no one else that could play him. Just like Harrison Ford embodies Indiana Jones and Bruce Willis is John McClane, Stallone is about as good as he has ever been here. He is quiet, he is strong and his physicality creates a character that many of us can empathize with and eventually root for. David Morell wrote a different character in his book but Stallone paints him more as a sympathetic character. He is correct in doing so. While Morell's vision is still present, this is more of Stallone's creation. Rambo is about as unique a character present in film history.First Blood is a film released in 1982, but in my opinion it set a new standard for action film stars. I think James Bond was pretty much your standard action film star before that. He was smooth and debonair and nothing went wrong for him. Rambo, at least in First Blood, is realistic. He bleeds, he cries, and he wears his emotion on his sleeve. This is someone that many of us could and can relate to. The sequels made him larger than life and that is fine, but this small film done by the Carolco guys is about as perfect a film as you can get.10/10",5
Rambo,"The ultimate action film and the ultimate psychological thriller! 'First Blood' was among others like 'Die Hard' as being one of the first action films I saw when I was younger, I even owned it on VHS. This film has Sly showing off his acting ability (which is saying something for an actor with such little capability of ""acting"") as the iconic John Rambo in the film that sparked off the eponymous film franchise, whilst the sequels were heavily classified as flops, 'First Blood' is a daring and thrilling survival adventure that follows a Vietnam Vet and the post-war trauma he suffers from. A dark yet sensitive film that follows one of the great action stars as he fights to survive, a mesmerising action masterpiece.",0
Rambo,"Surprise, a ""Rambo"" movie that tries to say something profound about the plight of its main character and his mental state.  For the most part it succeeds.  Not for this movie the ridiculously oiled pectorals of part II, where Rambo is transformed into a grunting, soul-less killing machine.  He actually begins the movie as a fairly nice chap, someone we can sympathise with, and it's his unnecessarily rough treatment at the hands of small-town sheriff Dennehey and his crew that is likely to shift audience sympathies firmly in the direction of the 'misunderstood' Vietnam vet.   Here, Rambo is also a character who is reluctant to kill unless he absolutely has to.  A far cry from the eventual homicidal maniac he was to become, who is seemingly responsible for more death than World Wars 1 & 2 combined.  So, to those expecting bucketloads of gore and senseless killing, you'd probably be better off watching the news.  ""First Blood"" is actually more akin to those 'survival in the wilderness' programs you might see on the Discovery Channel; with Rambo having to rely more on guile and cunning than brawn and an M-16 to get him out of tricky situations.   That's not to imply that this is boring.  Far from it.  Director Kotcheff shows a keen awareness of pace, it's never by any means certain that Rambo will survive (if you discount the other films, of course!) and the supporting characters are all wonderfully unsympathetic.  Even Trautmann, Rambo's supposed mentor, has a touch of the villain about him for being complicit in the ultimate dehumanisation of Rambo during the war.  By far the best character here is played by Dennehey; always watchable, but Stallone too is good; nicely restrained, more ""Cop Land"" than ""Cobra""
   Not an action film as such, it sits better as suspense. In that sense, it does exactly what it says on the tin; rendering John Rambo a far more interesting character here than his incarnation in the other two films. That is basically just wet-dream material for inadequate, spotty faced adolescent boys everywhere.  This Rambo is recognisably human.  Having said that, neither should you view expecting a solemn Vietnam protest movie in the vein of ""Platoon"" or ""The Deer Hunter"".  It's different in tone and style to the both of those movies, but in my view at least, is better than either of them.",5
Rambo,"The character of John Rambo became more popular in films such as ""Rambo:First Blood,Part II"" and ""Rambo III"".The character were treated like a comic book hero spawning action figures and a short lived animated series which lasted only a short while.There are not that many people who has heard of the Rambo character.He's well known through out,but today's generation would have been lucky to catch him on VHS or DVD.Back in 1982 when the character of John Rambo was introduced to movie screens,filmgoers were dealing with a character that was not displayed as an action icon,but a man who had a lot of demons within him.The best thing about ""First Blood"" is that John Rambo is not portrayed as an action hero.He is portrayed more as a man.A man who is haunted by memories of the Vietnam War.Sylvester Stallone plays the character of John Rambo very convincingly and Director Ted Kotcheff brings out the story to an effective scale allowing us to see the action through the character's eyes.Violence in films are the main aspects in film today.Or at least one of.It's fun to watch a violent film,but the violence in this film was not filmed to thrill the audience,but to make us understand what John Rambo is going through.I have these memories of first watching this film twenty years ago when I was twelve.""First Blood"" doesn't deal with CGI nor does it deal with special effects.It deals or tries to deal really hard on what is real.I like ""First Blood"" because I understand the character.He feels that society is against him and he is angry.A lot of films there is only one villain where as in this one society is the villain.That is according to Rambo.Actually,there is one villain named Sheriff Teasle played by Brian Dennehy.He and Rambo seemed to clash against each other and Ted Kotcheff let's us experience these two men go at it.I liked how the film shows Rambo trying to survive out in the woods while the guards are in hunting him when in turn he is hunting them creating these traps putting these officers in painful situations.The best thing about ""First Blood"" is that we know that John Rambo was in the Vietnam War and was trained to kill,yet,he doesn't kill a single human in the film on purpose.The killing of Galt was accidental and was deserving according to my eyes.This film is the best in the Rambo series because I understand the character and I understand why he is acting violent.""First Blood"" doesn't bring us John Rambo,the action hero but John Rambo,a regular man with a lot of demons he must face.""First Blood"" is the best of the Rambo series.",5
Rambo,"The adaptation of this novel to the big screen is a great accomplishment. The film is not only the beginning of one of the greatest action trilogies of all-time, but it charts the developments of its characters, something rarely done by an action movie.  ""First Blood"" is a moving story about the realities of post-Vietnam America and is very underrated as a film.",4
Rambo,"I totally agree with the comments of a previous reviewer who said that Sylvester Stallone is greatly underestimated as an actor. I wouldn't go as far as calling him the best actor that Hollywood has ever had, but he IS so much better than a lot of people say that he is. In my opinion Stallone shouldn't make comedies, but when it comes to action movies (Rambo, Rocky, Cobra, etc.) he's definitely one of the best! Rambo was a sensational movie in the 80's, but every time that I see it nowadays I'm amazed by the fact that it is actually a very good, original story. Brian Dennehy really shows his acting skills as well, leaving the audience confused whether to have sympathy for the character that he plays or to hate the character. First Blood is a movie filled with action. Like all the action movies from the 1980's ""First Blood"" also tends to become slightly over the top in the end. Still I gave it a 10/10 for the simple fact that I wanted to compensate for the people who ""underrate"" this movie. Normally I would give this movie an ""8"". If it had not been for the action scenes that are over the top this movie could even have scored a bit higher!",5
Rambo,"this is certainly not the greatest film ever made.  in fact, it's plot is predictable and formulaic, and every character is two-dimensional.having said that, this is a film that is often dismissed as a macho action flick with no redeeming feature.  these are opinions i would defy.while the only imagination put into the film seems to be the various ways in which John Rambo can kill people, the basic theme is nevertheless a pretty strong one.  this is not meant to be a Fellini-esque commentary on life, the universe, and everything.the three most important characters in the film are all played by pros. you have Stallone's John Rambo, Dennehy's Sheriff Teasle, and Richard Crenna's Colonal Trautman.Brian Dennehy hasn't missed a beat in his entire career; he's been a superb character actor since i've been watching movies, and - like Michael Caine - he always puts everything into each performance.  his Sheriff Teasle is menacing, bigoted, and protective.  he comes across like a man who's marked his territory and won't permit intrusions.  i won't say he's brilliant, but he is absolutely believable as a small-town sheriff faced with a situation so far out of his own experience that he cannot figure out why he can't solve the problem.Crenna is a patriarchial character, such as he often seems to play.  he gives the Spec Ops Colonal Trautman enough soul to make him seem human, and enough blood and guts to make him seem like a veteran soldier.
of course, the centrepiece to the film is Sylvester Stallone.  Stallone always suffers from the perception engendered by his appearance.  he is a somewhat short fellow with a body of bulging unpronoucable muscles, and a sad bassett-hound face that looks like it was designed by someone out of ""Oliver Twist.""but the man can flat-out act.  he gives John Rambo depth and reality.  he comes across as far too fit and far too silent because Rambo is far too fit and far too silent.  like his character in ""Copland,"" Stallone is playing a guy who pretty much wants to be left alone and is caught up by a bunch of people around him who are overly enthused by their own status.
while i can understand the dismissal of this film as just a patriotic action sop, i cannot also accept that Stallone does not give a good performance. the man has been characatured; he's an easy target.  he's a really built short-guy.  but Stallone's intelligence and creativity drove his first film, ""Rocky,"" and neither quality has deserted him since.  like Michael Caine, he does seem to take any old lame role offered to him.  but he always gets paid, and he always puts everything into his performances.
i'll never campaign for this film to be considered a ""great"" film, but i think i'll always defend it's star as a guy who works too hard too often to get the such little credit.i guess the best way i can put it is, i watched ""First Blood,"" and i believed him.  i believed Stallone.last time i checked, that is what an actor is supposed to do.",0
Rambo,"This movie was a classic.  A great action movie and a movie that really showed you what vietnam soldiers went through when they came back from the war.  Stallone plays John Rambo perfectly and he is physically excellent for the role as well.  He proves at the end alone that he can act and show emotion with the best of them.  The first time i saw this i was very emotional at the end because Stallone really gives you a taste of what the soldiers had to go through when they got home.  The action is classic, The acting is classic...RAMBO is Classic. 10/10.",5
Rambo,"This is a truly unique movie that quickly became obscured due to the later sequels.  It tells the story of a man who survived one hell, only to return home despised and forsaken because of it.  There was a time when America didn't quite know what to think of the lost war, and so it was forgotten - and the men who came out of it as well.  Rambo finds he cannot survive this war, because it is still going on within him.Finally, pushed too far by a small town sheriff, Rambo returns to the only thing he can relate to.  War.  Yet it is a war he almost mercifully wages on the macho egotistical deputies and week end warriors that pursue.  To potentially misquote Rambo :""I coulda killed them all, I could have killed you.  In town you're the law, out here it's me.  Let it go...""",0
Rambo,"My father served in the Vietnam war at the age of 21, much like John Rambo would have had he been real. In real life, my father endured a hell hole, a place he to this day, will rarely speak of without tears in his eyes, stories have been told to me about watching his friends die over there, of seeing atrocities done by both sides, a horrible horrific situation that no man woman or child should ever have seen.He spoke to me once, of returning to Australia, to a country he loved, called home. He spoke to me of feeling proud, in his uniform, having completed his tour, of stepping off the plane.And then he told me of the ridicule and scorn he received from the general public upon his return. A return where he was called a baby killer, despite never having actually killed anyone himself surprisingly, where it was simply assumed he was the one at fault, that the public would scorn him, forget he was human, treat him like a social outcast. Treat him, like an animal.Which is part of the reason he and I bonded so well over this movie when we first watched it. Sure, it's an agrandised tale of a badly treated Vet, a man forgotten by his government, much like my own father.When we see Stallone performing as Rambo in this movie, he's not fantastical, he's not superman, he's a man who's been wronged, who fights back the only way he knows how.When you see this movie, understand that this is, despite the fantastical elements in this film, a very accurate portrayal of how our veterans are treated. They're forgotten, they're given over to an ill equipped health system, be they in Australia or America, they're treated like outcasts.The beautiful thing about First Blood, when you watch it, is it's so easy to identify with Rambo, so easy to see he's just a good man, having a bad time, who reacts in possibly the worst way to whats happening to him... but that worst way, is the only appropriate way. The torture he endures under a biased prejudiced sheriff, the lack of respect for serving his country, the health system that should've picked up on his quite obvious PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), none of it was there for him.When it hits the fan, and Rambo goes on his escape, ask yourself, is he really hunting them? If they had've let him go, wouldn't it have been better for them? Didn't he just want to be left alone after all? The one message this movie, less than subtly puts across, is something we all need to learn. Whether its WW1 or 2, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm 1 or 2, you're not expected to agree with the war, you're not expected to support the war. But for gods sake support your troops. Next time your national day rolls around, like in Australia for Anzac Day, take the time to show a veteran, no matter if they're 25 or 95, show them they're appreciated, let them know they made a great sacrifice, that you respect what they did.Rambo succeeds on this level, especially Stallones final speech to Richard Crenna, which absolutely tears you apart, realising this man was plucked from obscurity, trained to be a god amongst normal men, then, when the machine of war was done with him, tossed out like a little spring from the machine, useless, unneeded and no longer wanted... where was he to go? What was he to do? It's a realistic situation that many, many veterans go through, google War Veteran Suicide rate sometime, it's an eye opening somewhat depressing look at the reality of the situation regarding our beloved Vets and the torturous return to mundane civilian life they have to go through...Don't respect the war, don't necessarily respect your government. But never, ever, disrespect the men and women who fight for your right to freedom. When you disrespect our soldiers, you disrespect everything our nations stand for. And that, is criminal.",5
Rambo,"Sure,""First Blood"" is known by people who have not seen it as a ""bang,bang,shoot 'em up"" action film. Yet,don't let what others think of it trick you. As said by another reviewer,""First Blood"" is a classic.Based off of the 1972 novel by David Morell,""First Blood"" is about a former green beret of the Vietnam War,John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone). Despite the fact that John Rambo gave a strong service to America during the years that he fought in Vietnam,lately,Rambo finds his life falling apart. This is something that has personally torn John Rambo apart.And then,one day,things take a turn for the worse. This is when John Rambo is arrested by a sheriff in a small Alaska town(Hope),Will Teasle(Brian Dennehey)for vagrancy. Shortly thereafter,before John Rambo knows it,his patience and mental state are being put to a test. The result? John Rambo escaping from the police and launching a one-man war against them and the national guard. The only person who can help everyone get through it all? Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna),a close friend of John Rambo who served with Rambo in Vietnam.Let's talk about ""First Blood"" on the whole. Similar to 1988's ""Die Hard"" and 1993's ""The Fugitive"",""First Blood"" is one of the most well-written and adapted films (despite the several differences between the film and the novel). Not only is the action in ""First Blood"" perfect for any action film,it is quite suspenseful. It is not in the script just for the sake of being there. It is in the script because it needs to be there. The action in ""First Blood"" works well into the script,and is only to be found where it belongs.There is a lot of good drama and chemistry in ""First Blood"",as well. On top of everything that John Rambo has gone through in his life being richly executed drama that fits in well with the action in ""First Blood"",the scenes with the action are not just action scenes. They are scenes that contain action,drama,and chemistry. This is due to viewers of ""First Blood"" being able to watch John Rambo fight the Police and the National Guard with not only his weapons,but at the same time,his mind. The acting is in top shape,also. All of the actors in ""First Blood"" succeed in understanding their characters and bringing their characters to life with their performances. Especially Sylvester Stallone. Will Stallone ever have the presence and respect in Hollywood that actors like Paul Newman,Al Pacino,and Robert De Niro,plus several others,have earned and achieved? Surely and probably,no. But,in his performance as John Rambo,Stallone executes the drama that his performance requires. At the same time,Stallone does not fail to let the action in ""First Blood"" to be entertaining. He gives it the kind of action you would expect to see in any film that is reminiscent of ""First Blood"" (""Lethal Weapon"",""Die Hard"",etc.). All of this is what helps ""First Blood"" fully come together,and make it the great film that it is.Overall,a must see-film for fans of not only action films,but for fans of crime drama films,as well.10/10",5
Rambo,"A lot of people know the Rambo series as a ridiculous 80's action series. But what a lot of people tend to forget is that the first movie in this series was not a ridiculous action movie. It's a serious, dark, thriller that has a very somber tone and a sympathetic lead character. Almost everything that Rambo is known for nowadays is completely absent in this movie. From the multitude of explosions to the high body count to the unrealistic action to the ridiculous story line is completely absent. There are only 2 or 3 explosions (not to mention they are realistically done) and only one person dies throughout the whole picture. and the action, while there isn't a lot, it's realistic. Even the story line you believe can actually happen. It's for these reasons that make this my favorite Rambo movie. And not to mention the fantastic and heart breaking performance given by Stallone. Why the Academy didn't nominate him for Best Actor at the Oscars is beyond me. If you didn't like the other Rambo movies because of their ridiculousness and haven't seen this film, I highly recommend seeing it. It's one of my favorite post-war movies if not one of my favorite movies of all time.Final rating: 9/10",5
Rambo,"How people can call this the worst one of the series or just a bad movie in general is beyond me. The action is actually believable and not something out of a video game. And the storyline is good and paints a good picture of life in America after the Vietnam war. Following the tale of the best of the best it is certainly not the best but very good. Better yet is the laughs that come from watching the bad cops get theirs. The only I have to complain about this movie is that the sequels were atrocious and painful. This is often looked over excellent movie that puts many other in the genre to shame. Many of you who find it boring are just gore junkies who thrive off of cheap explosions and a plethora of bullets in the air. Take it for a man trying to survive, not bringing down a whole army.",4
Rambo,"Smart, well-plotted, action-filled, ultimately moving war film about a mentally unstable Vietnam vet who returns stateside to find another war raging - one against veterans.Stallone gives a very good, understated performance - his action sequences are so realistic that it's hard to believe that no one got hurt during the filming. Dennehy is also superb as the chief pursuing officer, whose ragtag bunch of cops includes a small role for David Caruso.I really did like this movie. I liked the overarching social message, and the unexpected twists and turns that follow a pretty routine event - a sheriff rousting a drifter, getting much more than he bargained for.",5
Rambo,"Sylvester Stallone as Rambo is a previous Green Beret who is forced to save himself from a redneck sheriff ( Brian Dennehy) and deputies ( Bill Mckinney , Jack Starrett, David Caruso ). Rambo is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully jailed and he pull off the break-out . The authorities set off in pursuit and he lead them into all type of dangerous , booby traps in the woods and mountains of the Oregon State . Rambo appears threatening , lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping of innumerable risks and dangers . Former colonel (Richard Crenna) will attempt to stop and detain him .From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it is fast movement for that reason the picture is quite entertaining. The outdoors are spectaculars , the landscapes have been filmed in natural parks . Stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel ex soldier and Richard Crenna is top notch as the anterior trainer officer. Appears unbilled Bruce Greenwood (JFK in Thirteen days ),almost extra ,and screen debut from David Caruso and Chris Mulkey . Awesome and exceptional cinematography by Andrew Laszlo filmed on location in Golden Ears Provincial Park,Hope, North Vancouver, Pitt Lake, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada. Splendid and magnificent musical score by the great maestro Jerry Goldsmith. The motion picture is followed by Rambo series : First blood II in which Rambo returns at Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war and Rambo III against the Russians who control a particular sector of Afghanistan . The trilogy was a completed by the recent Rambo , a definitive improvement, with Julie Benz and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand . The quartet was a complete success though the best considered is the original . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans ; it's a movie for adrenaline lovers . Rating : Good , entertaining but violent . This exciting and moving motion picture is professionally directed by Ted Kotcheff. Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this intelligent film still has its agreeable moments. This large-scale and lavishly produced picture attempts a special atmosphere with spectacular results. Two thumbs up",4
Rambo,"I, like many, have probably grown up with Rambo being a part of popular culture. From all those references to such an iconic character I was expecting some war film centered around an unstoppable killing machine. I was completely wrong, and thankfully so. Rambo is the story of a dark and troubled man. Rambo isn't a hero, but he should have been. He's a man that came home with no one to welcome him. He drifts from town to town, antagonised wherever he goes. One day a police force pushes him too far. Rambo's mental instabilities take hold and he pledges a war against these men in authority. There are no clearcut villains, and certainly no heroes here. We empathise with Rambo, and understand the police action taken against him. As well as being a commentary on the treatment of Vietnam Vets, it also shows how war isn't an excuse for such violent actions. Dennehy's wonderful character is shown (very subtly) as a soldier that managed to find his path. At the same time Dennehy doesn't know when to quit, his pride getting in the way. This is an action film with real substance, real issues, and real discussions to be had. It also never fails to deliver on the action, and Stallone's final emotional breakdown will relate to anyone that's been pushed too far. A film focused mostly on understanding, not excusing. I regret waiting this long to watch it.",5
Rambo,First Blood is that rare film that is not black and white instead it deals with areas of Gray. Stallone's Acting is Very Good maybe the Finest he's ever done outside of F.I.S.T. And Yet while his Rambo is a compelling portrait of a man slowly going insane trying to find something resembling peace. Rambo never finds it. All he finds is hatred and fear aimed at him and that makes them hostile towards him. The Main Villain in this if you can call him one is Police Chief Wil Teasle wonderfully played by Brian Dennehy. The interaction between the two is tense and that's before the shooting starts. But this is Stallone's movie and his Tour de force as he creates a complex character that many have a hard time separating from the Real Stallone. Richard Crenna Steals the Show as Colonel Sam Trautman United States Special Forces coming all the way from fort Bragge to come get his boy. Crenna underplays his role cool as anyone has a right to be. Together this cast sets off a match headed towards Kegs of Gunpowder and dynamite First Blood does not disappoint and it will stay with you long after you've seen it.,5
Rambo,"Rambo is more than a cartoon character. He is the alter-ego of a generation. However, they could just as easily have dressed him in a suit and written nearly the same script. In that way, 'Rambo' perpetuates the stereotyped Viet Nam War veteran as a semi-literate, underemployed drifting soul. Many of the clichd expressions used to describe John Rambo in the film are metaphors for the way real-life Vietnam War veteran were regarded: ""Crazy,"" ""psycho,"" ""loser,"" to name a few things that the character was called in the film. He added a few, (they called me)""...baby killer,"" ""In Nam I was somebody, I was in charge of million dollar equipment, I could drive a tank, fly a chopper. In the end, that he cried was out of character. Nonetheless, the character, 'John Rambo,' did what many of us wanted to do, and many did in their own way: Smack society down for using us and throwing us away, scorned. The interesting thing to note is that the character, Sheriff Teasley, is played by Brian Dennehy, an actor who lied about serving in Viet Nam when he did not. Among veterans, lying about service in Viet Nam is a shameful act. Yet the many who have done so in some way supports the idea that Viet Nam, in the national conscience, was a heroic venture. It was.",4
Rambo,"One of the things that surprised me the most when I watched First Blood for the first time was that it wasn't an action film. Yes it had a lot of stunts and some action sequences but it wasn't the blow things up, in your face, guns blazing action that you might associate with Rambo films. Instead First Blood had a story...an important story...with a character that instilled itself into pop culture infamy forever and its easy to see why and how. First Blood is about stereotyping, profiling, exclusion, war and watching it nowadays makes it even more important than it was then or later on. With eye opening Vietnam films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Casualties of War and so forth First Blood did something that those films weren't able to do...take the exact same message and bring it to the mainstream public with one of the biggest stars of the day. In a way First Blood is almost shocking because essentially John Rambo is NOT the hero. I suppose he could be considered the 'anti-hero' but his actions are not saving anyone, and in fact hurting innocent people who can't possibly fight him but try to no avail anyways. Still the message is clear and it's a very story driven film with the creation of a movie icon.I'll argue with anyone, anytime...Sylvester Stallone is a very talented actor AND a very talented writer. No one could ever touch the character of John Rambo the way he did. Stallone went way beyond the action genre and actually created John Rambo from personality and history and his movements, everything. In this first installment he laid the groundwork for Rambo. Quiet, brooding, scorned, angry, unstable, haunted, deeply emotional but buried beneath all these other emotions. I think that's a hell of a performance in my books. Brian Dennehy is Stallone's rival and does a terrific job playing the conceited and determined small town sheriff who will stop at nothing to bring Rambo down. The two of them have a terrific on screen chemistry and Dennehy is a first rate actor. Richard Crenna adds to the cast as Rambo's only true 'family' and the one person he trusts. Crenna doesn't give a lot of variation to his performance, he's just kind of there to inform everyone of what Rambo is capable of. He is sort of monotoned and straight faced but he's a Rambo series staple and the character he plays is very important.Watch the end of this film closely for John Rambo's break down in the Grocery store when Traut (Crenna) tells him ""It's over."" You know the infamous line ""Not that it's over."" Watch the scene that follows and then tell me that you're not moved and blown away by Stallone's performance. It's real and it's important. First Blood by some will be considered untouchable by the rest because they see it for what it was likely meant to be...a drama...and important drama with a message but the film makers created this incredible character and by the time the film is done you're thinking one thing; I want to see this guy in his element in the action that they speak of and then you have the serializing of Rambo (which you will see by my review is NOT a bad thing.) I suppose I'm judging First Blood on it's merit of being considered an action film because as great as Stallone is and how interesting the film is...I didn't find it mind blowingly entertaining. Still the film is well made an absolute classic and definitely worth seeing. If you're a huge Rambo fan then you can find a lot of hidden details about this mysterious man that Stallone created. It's a must see on any list. 8/10 **************** NOTE Yesterday on Tuesday January 22/2008 star of big screen hits Heath Ledger passed away in his home. I just want to wish his family, his daughter, and Michelle Williams and all his friends my deepest sympathy and I always believed he was destined to be a big star. I will most certainly miss his work.",4
Rambo,"First Blood is based on a novel which, although I have never read, differs greatly from the film version. Stallone is John Rambo, who enters a small pacific northwest town as a grizzled looking loner in search of an old army buddy from Vietnam. After learning of the death of his friend from Agent Orange the previous summer, Rambo wanders into town looking for something to eat and is instantly confronted by the local sheriff, Will Teasel, brilliantly portrayed by Brian Dennehey. Teasle personifies the iconic small town sheriff, bullying, arrogant, drenched in ego. Teasle sizes up Rambo as a transient, taking particular offense to the flag on Rambo's army jacket, and makes it clear his kind is not welcome in the bucolic little hamlet he is charged to protect. Aside from his past in Vietnam, little is known about Rambo at this point, but Stallone does do an admirable job of capturing the psychological instability of his character which becomes more pronounced as Teasle pushes him harder. What ensues is an escalation of tensions resulting in Teasle arresting Rambo, ostensibly for nothing more than challenging his authority to dictate who can come and go in his one horse town.After his arrest, Rambo is treated brutally by the local deputies. Each is eager to impress the sheriff and lack the moral and intellectual capacity to function outside of their little world. They see Rambo as an opportunity to reaffirm their own power over someone who clearly, by virtue of his size and self confidence, has power over each of them. Their tactics to subdue and interrogate Rambo border on torture which pushes Rambo over the edge, setting off the warrior instinct he cultivated in Vietnam. He quickly overpowers the deputies, and Teasle, and effects an escape into the nearby mountains. It is here where Rambo sets the stage for his one man war, on his own terms.After igniting this firestorm, and after Rambo proves more than a match for his poorly trained and incompetent deputies trying to hunt him down, Teasle learns who Rambo really is, and what he has just gotten himself into. Rambo is a former Green Beret and recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Later, after the state police and national guard are mobilized to apprehend Rambo, Colonel Sam Trautman arrives at the behest of the army to defuse the situation. Trautman was Rambo's commanding officer in Vietnam, and provides a little more insight to the man Teasle considered nothing more than a psychotic drifter. Trautman recruited and trained Rambo as a member of an elite group of soldiers. Trautman, seemingly bragging, informs Teasle just who he is messing with: An expert with guns, with knives, with his bare hands, trained as a perfect killing machine. He adds ""I didn't come here to save Rambo from you. I came to save you from him."" Several explosions, spent shell casings, booby traps, and a couple million dollars worth of property damage later, Trautman convinces Rambo to surrender. But not before an impassioned monologue from Rambo revealing the tortured, conflicted soul of man haunted by his past, living without purpose in a world which doesn't want him.First Blood remains a favorite of mine although much more could have been done with it. Stallone does a good job with Rambo, but he would not have been my first choice. Stallone is a limited actor who made his mark as Rocky Balboa; a noble yet two dimensional character. Rocky works well for Stallone given the lack of emotional and intellectual range, but Rambo required a little more depth and nuance to really sympathize with him. Stallone's portrayal comes off as a little rigid and icy, although is not unclear that Rambo still struggles to retain his humanity. At the end of the film he lets loose his rage against a contemptuous society than neither understands him nor appreciates the sacrifices he made for them. Rambo is in many respects a hero, a man molded into an instrument of perfection for a single purpose, to fight and win for a greater purpose. Now that the war is over he has no place, no identity, and only the lingering pain of the past. His tearful rail at the end encapsulates the pain of a soldier no one cares for after having fought a war no one wanted. Stallone remarked in an interview recently that his monologue at the end of First Blood was probably the best acting he's done on film. I would tend to agree.In a greater context, I think the story, while at times totally unbelievable, is a commentary on America's attitude toward Vietnam and the way it handled the soldiers who returned. In a microcosmic sense, this small hick town represents the scorn and apathy of a culture which was, at the time, confused and angered about it's own identity and struggle to regain the power it relinquished to defeat in Vietnam. Rambo too is angry and confused, yet he never turned against his country until they turned against him. Then he gave them a war they could not believe. ""It was YOUR war! You asked me, I didn't ask you!"".An interesting side note: In the novel Rambo dies at the end. The film was to have ended the same way with Rambo asking Trautman to shoot him rather than letting him rot in a cell for years. ""You made me, you kill me. You owe me that."" But it was changed, for a variety of reasons most notably sequels, to allow Rambo to live. This ending was filmed and can be seen on Youtube as an alternate ending. It's actually pretty good.An excellent film. Thought provoking, engaging, well acted and well directed. I recommend this one.",4
Rambo,My Rating : 8/10I am a huge fan of Sly and this right here is one of his best!This is my childhood movie I grew up with and will always have a special place in my heart. They drew first blood. THEY DREW FIRST BLOOD.,4
Password,"""Password"" was one of those rare game shows in which contestants had to rely on mental abilities *other* than memory. Contestants on games such as ""Jeopardy"" and ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" rely on their memories, or those of others, to come up with answers.Unfortunately, the game placed people who do not have a great command of the English language at a disadvantage. People who have English as a second language may not have done too well in this game.Nevertheless, ""Password"" demanded that the contestant make an intellectual effort to take a word (idea) and convey it someone else. That kind of effort takes imagination and insight in the nuances of language to do well. It's a cerebral game; maybe that's why Allen Ludden said: ""Some time, somewhere, some day there will be another game show, but never one with the class of this one.""",0
Password,"Every saturday, I watch the reruns of Password on Game Show Network.  I think this is a fun game to play and I like to make up my own games and play it with my family.  Allen Ludden (God rest his soul) was a very good host too.",0
Password,"Alan Ludden was truly a class act. One of a very few of the great game show hosts like Bill Cullen and Tom Kennedy. Password was a show that required the contestants to at least have a vocabulary--something that's sadly missing in today's game show world.I remember the last episode of Mr. Ludden's tenure--they drank champagne on air. Can anybody help me on this?: I was very young, but I seem to remember one of those 5 word bonus rounds they played with George Peppard--8 seconds! Am I right? Was this the record? Can't find any internet or you tube references. Anyone? Bueller?",5
Password,"Password was definitely a true classic as a well as a pioneer in the game show genre. It had all the elements for success. A simple format, home audience participation (if you didn't look at the word on the screen) and an outstanding host in Allen Ludden. He was the best game show host of all-time since he kept the game moving, treated both the celebrities and contestants very well and showed a lot of class. He was also one of the best dressed emcees and one of the first to wear open shirts.As a game show pioneer, Password was the first to pair contestants with celebrities and the first to use a bonus round, Without Password, there would have been no Pyramid. Both games were created by Bob Stewart.The original version would have lasted longer if CBS wouldn't have preempted the show on the same day The Newlywed Game debuted for a Vietnam War news conference. The Chuck Barris show cut into Password's dominance. Also, Fred Silverman, who headed CBS Daytime Programming was not a fan of game shows and he killed off classics such as I've Got a Secret, What's My Line and Password. But fear not, the game was the first to air reruns and that led to the 70s revival on ABC.As for the 70s version, it was also ground breaking. It was the first network game show to be revived, though Goodson-Todman survived through a network game show drought with syndicated versions of What's My Line, To Tell the Truth and Beat the Clock and it was also the company's first show to be produced in Hollywood. When Password returned in 1971, the main game and Lightning Round remained the same. The only change was the addition of the Betting Word, where a contestant can double their winnings by guessing another password in 15 seconds. There was also an updated set and new theme music and of course, Allen Ludden as host. This version was a success for three years before the format became old and tired. Instead of cancelling the show, the producers changed the format and title to Password All Stars. An outstanding game was ruined by more complicated rules and the fact that game show fans like to see real people win money instead of celebrities playing for charities. Even Allen Ludden was uncomfortable with the new format. Eventually, the show went back to using civilian contestants but the game was still too complicated and was cancelled in June 1975. I'll always remember Allen Ludden closing each show with ""The password for today is...""",0
Password,"First off, I must say that this is a fun game show. Also, since I'm 24, I haven't seen every episode. However, I do know the show very well. Every time I've watched it, I've had a lot of fun playing along and watching. Despite the fact that it's finished its run, this makes me long to be a contestant. The thing I like most about it are the questions. Despite the fact that I don't know that many answers, I still have fun playing along. I hope the Game Show Network keeps it on so I can play along and watch again. If that happens, I will be really happy. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever. Now, in conclusion, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.",4
Password,"When I first discovered that ""Password"" reruns were airing on GSN a few years ago, I made it a point to get as many episodes on VHS as I could since there's no telling when the entire series will go into DVD. It's a pity that a lot of the game shows run on GSN don't have the class and continuity that ""Password"" did. Allen Ludden was always a great host - perfect for a game show like this. And like a lot of the game shows in the sixties and seventies, they made you think. I can also thank whoever made the decision at CBS to hang on to some of these great programs of that era such as ""Password"" for people to enjoy over again. I don't think the contestants were ever overawed by their celebrity partners and naturally we all found out how human they can be trying to think of a word to say in a few seconds from one-word clues. AND DON'T EVER SAY THE PASSWORD AS A CLUE...OOPS!!!!",5
Password,"The excitement and fun of a retro game show can be found in ""Password,"" the famous TV game show where two teams, ""$100,000 Pyramid"" style, try to win big bucks. One person reads out a clue on a folded up piece of paper while the other person tries to guess the word. There are up to five clues revealed on the board above, and one team must figure out what the actual word really is!!!!! And now, my two favorite variations that currently run on GSN:""Password Plus:"" It stars Allen Ludden, who looked (no offense) really awful, like he always wore a raincoat to the show or something. Anyways, it had the most colorful set, and it had ""Alphabetics,"" which gave the contestant a chance at big bucks!!!!! I once saw a man go through it fast and correctly about a week ago and that was awesome!!!!!""Super Password:"" It stars Bert Convy and the set looked different, like a huge NES system; almost! Everything's the same, except that there's ""Ca$hword"" now. I also like how the word appears on screen and the noise that accompanies it!!!!!C'mon, folks!!!!! These versions of ""Password"" meant good entertainment for everyone; this is stuff our parents (and us as little children) watched when they just got married!!!!! So watch them on GSN or else!!!!!10 stars",5
Terminator,"The Terminator is one of those films that no matter if you've seen it or not, you've heard of it, heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it! This is the movie that blasted then new comer's Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's career, made James Cameron a name in Hollywood, and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every ""bad"" scene with violence or nudity, needless to say about 70% of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love, this wasn't just an action movie, though it is one of the best, it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that James Cameron had, he didn't have much money, but he had a good script, a great crew on his side to make one of cinema's greatest movies of all time.Two men appear in Los Angeles in separate locations, manifesting in sudden, blinding flash-storms of electricity. One is heavily muscular; the other man, slim and wiry. The mysterious muscular man obtains weapons and begins hunting down all women named ""Sarah Connor"", using a phone book to track his targets. He successfully kills the first two of the three listed women. When he attempts to kill the last Sarah Connor, he is stopped by the other man, Kyle Reese who has been sent back in time to protect her. While hiding in a parking garage, Reese explains that the man hunting Sarah is actually a cyborg assassin called a ""Terminator"", built by Skynet, an artificial intelligence network created by Cyberdyne Systems. In the near future, Reese explains, Skynet gained self-awareness, initiated a global takeover of military hardware, and launched a nuclear war against humanity. Skynet ordered that a scant number of humans were to be kept alive in order to be used as slave labor. John Connor, Sarah's son, rallied the few remaining humans and led a resistance movement against the machines. After a grinding campaign, the human resistance was on the verge of victory; in a last-ditch effort, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John was born, preventing the resistance from ever being founded and allowing the machines to win by default. Reese volunteered to follow the Terminator back in time to protect Sarah; after his use of the time transportation equipment, it was to be destroyed by the resistance in order to prevent further Terminators from going back in time. The Terminator feels no pain, has no emotions, and will stop at nothing to accomplish its mission.The Terminator is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, I think because this movie really is something special. Yeah, the effects are very 80's, but for the time and even to this day, I think the special effects are much better than the CGI crud we get in today's cinema. This has everything: action, romance, horror, sci-fi, and even some dark humor. The reason why Arnold's ""I'll be back"" is so famous is not just because of his accent, but because you knew that something bad was coming. Kyle Reese's ""Come with me if you want to live"" is classic as well. If you haven't seen The Terminator, I highly recommend this movie, it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest. This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I'm sure that you will not be disappointed, if you are, get a CAT scan.10/10",5
Terminator,"Rarely has a film so frightened an audience as ""The Terminator."" After its release in 1984, the extremely low-budget sci-fi actioner broke box office records, and gave audiences something more to fear. Through the years, there have been stories of nature's beasts, of creatures from another world, and so on and so forth. ""Jaws"" was terrifying because it seemed so possible. And if ""Jaws"" is terrifying, ""The Terminator"" is horrific. The realization of this hit-man machine dawned on everyone watching the film. In a time of exceeding technology, how long will it be before man is overtaken by the very things he created? And that is what is particularly scary about a film like ""The Terminator."" In ""The Terminator,"" Arnold plays a cyborg, Cyberdyne system model 101, a T800, whatever that means. He has been sent back in time to assassinate the soon-to-be-mother of the future world leader, John Connor (who battles the machines in the future and leads an uprising). If Connor is killed, then there will be no one to oppose the machines of the future, and they will triumph. This would be pretty bad. So the future John Connor has sent a protector back in time, to help save his mother. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) tells Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) about the machine that is trying to kill her. ""It can't be bargained with, it can't feel pain or mercy, and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead!"" Talk about a bad day.The Terminator hunts them down time after time, including the famous police station scene, where Arnie says, ""I'll be back,"" and returns moments later, crashing through the wall in a car. He then takes on a whole squad of cops, but don't worry, Sarah and Reese escape slightly unscathed.There are countless classic scenes in ""The Terminator."" You will see them spoofed your entire life. From the image of the Terminator, to the lines they speak, to the scenes they act out. Everything is spoofed. And the film is worthy of its fame.On the special edition ""T2"" DVD (the second one), there is an on-set documentary for the making of the ""Terminator 2"" 3-D ride at Universal Studios. As the camera moves around, it shows Cameron detailing what he wants in this scene. Some guy suggests something else, and Cameron gets a tone. ""No, no, that won't work. You do it like this - we come off here, he walks around..."" etc. The point is, he's a perfectionist, and a demanding director. Some directors are a bit too easy, and don't really care where their films are going. But James Cameron seems to have a clear vision of what he wants, and he goes around making sure it gets done exactly the way he wants it to be done. And it shows in his work. It's hard to find any mistakes in a James Cameron film. And it's even harder to find plot holes.Some people say ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day"" is better than the original. It's hard to choose, because the two films are very different. I view ""The Terminator"" as more of a deep, intellectually-consuming, dark thriller. I view ""Judgment Day"" as an action film, with a more or less recycled plot. (The plot is still good, but it's still the same, too.) It's hard to choose a favorite because they are so different. On ""T2"" the budget is ten times larger, probably even more than that. But if you want a horror/thriller, ""The Terminator"" is better for you. If you want special-effects and a really fun time, see ""T2."" They're both excellent films.""The Terminator"" is a great movie. It is one of my favorites; it is terrifying, horrifying, and 100 % entertaining. And unlike a lot of other cheap actioners out there, ""The Terminator"" has some thought put into its plot, and that is what separates it from the rest of its kind.",5
Terminator,"Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).As we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  First I have to mention Michael Biehn.  He has the real starring role.  He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him.  Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies "" Terminator's don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't do that again. ""  That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  Biehn is perfect for the role.This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  And they are so passionate with what they have to say.  I like it when a film has something to say.  I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.  This is a masterpiece.Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film.  One, this is the first film where ""I'll be back"" was spoken.  Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular.  Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it.  And he adds spark to any film that he's in.  Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.A great film.",5
Terminator,"The Terminator (1984) is a masterpiece, the best sci-fi action classics horror movie that started all the Terminator movies. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie and my personal favorite action film. I love this film to death it is my childhood film I grew up with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was The Terminator T-800 Model 101 indestructible killing machine cyborg. This movie is brilliant, it has brilliant story, brilliant plot, excellent additional cast, brilliant director and writers, good special effects, it is mixed with sci-fi, action and horror. This movie deals with the war that was set in the future but the battle will be fought in the present. It deals with paradox travel trough time.""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead! ""This is the perfect action film of all time and still even today over 30 years it is a cult classic. The plot and the script provides excellent dialogues. Why it is brilliant? Imagine someone did something in the future and didn't know about it and becomes a primal target for extermination from a killer cyborg from the future now in the present. That is brilliant and excellent idea and story.Two naked men appear in different locations in los Angeles trough flash blue light and electricity they were both set in time from the year 2029 to the present year 1984. One is a human the other is an indestructible cyborg reprogramed to find and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) the woman whose unborn son will become humanity's only hope in the future war against the machines. The other men is a human being a soldier from the future who has to find Sarah Connor and protect her at all cost. That's the basically plot for this film.James Cameron writes and directs this film with his than wife Gale Anne Hurd who also produced this film and they both does that brilliantly. The script with the story provides a perfect action entertainment trough whole film.Brad Fiedel does a wonderful music theme for The Terminator character and action sequences, car chases and does a drama in which Sarah and Kyle have sex together in the motel room. That's how John was later in the sequel born. Great music score for the film. I love the soundtracks from this film: Photoplay 
 and Burnin' in the Third Degree by Tryanglz.Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the top of his career. This movie bring his career at top of the action stars. Arnold is excellent and he performs excellent and acts brilliant as The Terminator. At one time his agent pursued Schwarzenegger to play the action hero, but Schwarzenegger wasn't interested to be an action hero he was interested to be The Terminator and he played brilliantly well and believable enough. Before Sarah Connor was a tough bad-ass gun guerilla squad in the sequels, here she was a scared victim. A beautiful young woman who was a waitress at the diner and was just a human being leaving a teenage normal life in Los Angeles. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor no else can replace her. She is beautiful and smart and it is my favorite Linda Hamilton movie. She acts very realistic, brilliant and perfectly as the scared victim. Linda Hamilton is the best of the film.Michael Biehn is the only Sgt. Kyle Reese no one else is or can replace him. He is excellent and brilliant I still prefer Corporal Dwayne Hicks but Kyle Reese is my favorite character from Michael Biehn he is a perfect action hero. I love Kyle Reese because he doesn't kill any human being. Lance Henriksen from Aliens and Hard Target is in here and he plays Detective Hal Vukovich and he is very good and realistic as the detective.Paul Winfield is Lieutenant Ed Traxler first he doesn't believe Kyle Reese story but later he witness it him self. I wish there wouldn't be deleted scene in which Kyle and Sarah finds Traxler dying and he gives Kyle a gun. This movie has ton's of action: You see a lot of automatic weapons, shotguns and handguns used in this film and they are used well. You have a car chase between The Terminator and Kyle Reese with Sarah and both men are shooting at each other. Terminator has a stolen Police car and Kyle fires his shotgun and hits twice the Terminator once in the eye. The Terminator than crashes with the car in the wall. In the next scene you see Terminator's eye bloody. You have a great car chase by the end of the film Terminator with truck tries to kill Sarah but Kyle put's a pipe bomb in the truck and you see a huge explosion the truck explodes great special effect. Terminator shoot's with an IMI Uzi in Tech Noir night club. Killing bunch of people in which Kyle stops him with a shotgun. Terminator crash with the car in the police station and kills almost 19 cops.When we see The Terminator been all burned out without flesh with only been endoskeleton covered with steel with his red eyes glowing that is scary when he chases Sarah is scary when I was 6 years old I screamed when I saw that skeleton cyborg attacking Kyle and Sarah. The Terminator is a 1984 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron.10/10 Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval The Terminator is a masterpiece a science fiction action horror film, a film I love to death and it is my personal favorite Schwarzenegger film. This is Schwarzenegger's best film with Predator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day I highly recommend those three films.",5
Terminator,"Even in this post-Matrix era, this movie is still the ultimate blend of Orwell and action. If the definition of a classic is a movie that's often imitated but never equaled, then The Terminator is definitely a classic, because the increasing redundancy of its sequels and imitations merely demonstrates how good the original is.I wasn't fortunate enough to see this movie in the year of its release, the year predicted by Orwell's classic novel as a time when technology would be used to enslave people, but I did see it in about 1992, when the blockbuster success of the first sequel made me curious to watch the first film. At that time I preferred the second Terminator movie for being technically superior, but after all these years I now prefer the first film's raw intensity and kinetic energy.The Terminator was of course the breakthrough movie for James Cameron, and even after Aliens and Titanic it's still arguably his best-directed film. I challenge anybody to watch this movie and point out one single shot that needs improvement, because the direction of this movie is so fluid and precise that I can't think of one moment in the whole 100-minute running time that I would want to change.Cameron was and of course still is a notorious perfectionist who's very difficult to work with, but his perfectionism really paid off with this movie because it can be watched again and again without losing its entertainment value. He's a master of the small touch, as when the cop at the desk is filling out his paperwork with a small pencil and pauses in mid-sentence to look up and see the headlights coming towards him through the doors.Cameron also co-wrote the story, so this movie meant even more to him personally than merely a directing triumph. Supposedly he drew his inspiration from a nightmare in which he was being chased by a humanoid with one glowing red eye, and indeed the whole film has the urgent, oppressive atmosphere and calm logic characteristic of a nightmare. But of course he was probably also remembering subconsciously a couple episodes of The Outer Limits that he saw as a kid, which explains why he had to acknowledge the writer Ellison in the credits.Besides Cameron, this movie really belongs to the three lead actors. Arnold of course gives the performance of his career in this movie, but then so do Linda and Michael. Arnold's physical presence and harsh accent have never been put to better use in a movie, while Linda never had another role that required her to run through such a full range of emotions--sweetness and vulnerability, toughness and despair, etc.Michael has always been a B actor, but since The Terminator is essentially a B movie he fits in perfectly. His performance proves that an action hero is much more compelling when he's vulnerable not only to physical pain but emotional difficulties, to which his big, haunted eyes are put to good use. Watch him in this movie, as a man thrown out of his time but with a mission, and you'll see a perfect match of actor and character.In a typical action film, the amount of violence and bloodshed in The Terminator would be excessive, but in a movie about an unstoppable killing machine the envelope can be pushed. In one of the more memorable set-pieces, the Terminator takes on an entire police station full of thirty cops, and although I didn't exactly count them the viewer gets the sense of watching every single cop being gunned down.Ordinarily I wouldn't describe such a scene of slaughter as ""cool,"" and yet there is some-thing undeniably cool about Arnold, with his sunglasses and leather jacket, going through the station with a shotgun and assault rifle and taking on everybody. Arnold's charisma helps the audience stomach the cold-blooded determination of the Terminator, but also the character's single-mindedness invites admiration: even as we're appalled by all the killing, we have to admit he does it rather well.This movie has more than enough gunfire, explosions and stunt-work (including some especially good stunt driving) to work purely as an action picture, but it's the film's anti-technology paranoia that makes it more than just an exciting ride. Notice, for example, the subtle role that Sarah's answering machine plays in the story: the cops can't get into touch with her because of it, while the message she leaves on it brings the Terminator right to her.In one memorable shot, the tracks of a construction crane become those of a killing machine in the future, crushing an endless row of skulls, which you can interpret any number of ways (is it a crack against urban renewal?). Also note that the criminal psychologist is enslaved by his beeper, and that even in the post-apocalyptic future in which machines have destroyed the world children still huddle around a television set in a desperate effort to be entertained.Some viewers may be turned off by this movie's preaching, but one quality that distinguishes The Terminator from its countless imitations is the strength of its convictions. Too many science-fiction/action movies fail under the weight of their own camp, but The Terminator is an exception because it actually has the nerve to take itself seriously. The bickering between seasoned cops Paul and Lance provides some levity, but at no point does the film make fun of itself.The only reason I'm not giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is, after all, The Terminator, and not Casablanca. If people still remember it in forty years, then I'll give it a 10.",5
Terminator,"The Terminator is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. It doesn't set a single foot wrong and it also kicked off a wonderful saga. Without this, there would be no Terminator 2. Think about that. As such, this movie is fondly remembered by many people and it has been the subject of many quotes and spoofs over the years. Why doesn't it set a foot wrong? It is thrilling, almost always entertaining and filled with insane explosions, which more or less makes a good action movie. But 'The Terminator' stands head and shoulders above the rest of it's genre, because of it's well thought-out plot, splendid acting and an eerily memorable music score which gives you a reason to watch the credits at the end.Now to analysing why the plot is so well-thought out. Well, for one thing, the concept of preventing or setting in stone the future by going back in time was one which wasn't really explored in those days. By exploring it, the Terminator was offering something different, something which has inspired films such as Back to the Future (read the plot synopsis for that film, there are a few similarities). The notion of the final battle of a future war being fought in 'our present', not in the future, between one member of opposing sides, in this case a man and a machine, is also an intriguing one and sets the stage for an exciting battle royale.I'll run down the plot while I'm here. Sarah Connor, a young woman in her 20's, is the protagonist of the film and our two from the future, Kyle Reese and the Terminator, revolve around her. Reese, who is a battle-hardened soldier who has led a hard life in the wasteland which is the future, must protect Sarah, while the Terminator, an unstoppable cyborg, must kill her, in order to kill her unborn son, the leader of the future resistance.All of this leads to some thrilling action scenes and insane explosions, topped off by music scores which add to the tension and excitement. The movie purrs into action quickly, but really kicks off at a disco, where Reese and the Terminator have a shootout, resulting in a city-wide drive-by chase involving the police which doesn't really let up until Reese and Sarah are arrested. During the lull in the chase scene, Reese tells Sarah about himself, the Terminator and their general predicament, which is fairly realistic. The next action scene is the infamous police station massacre which everyone seems to talk about whenever they discuss this movie. I can understand why, too. The Terminator pretty much kills every cop in his path with the greatest of ease, either with the AK-47, his shotgun, or both. He also ends up cutting the power and setting the station on fire, again adding to the tension and excitement. The last action scene which, like the one in T2, is a chase which leads to a final showdown in a building. It is a slight letdown, but it is still an intense scene. I will refrain from spoiling the ending, as this is too good a movie to be spoiled.All of the acting fits the bill perfectly. As in T2, there is not a single bad performance to be found. Michael Biehn delivers a remarkably intense performance as Kyle Reese, acting like a typical human would in his situation. He displays his range of emotions at the right times, from passionate to worried to unyielding. It is a wonder that his only other major movie is 'Aliens' and that he is starring in stuff like 'Clockstoppers' these days. Linda Hamilton again does well as Sarah Connor, displaying an innocent woman who shows over the course of the film why she is John Connor's mother, displaying previously unheralded steel at the crunch. The support cast isn't too bad either (Dr. Silberman makes his first appearance). But again, the best performance in the film belongs to the bad guy, in this case, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He acts like a killing machine should; incredibly cold, sterile, soulless and unyielding. His facial expression never changes throughout the film and his physical appearance makes him slightly more imposing and intimidating than the Liquid Terminator. He also commences his famous one-liners which have been the subject of many a spoof, including (no, especially) ""I'll be back."" This is undoubtedly his best performance, even though it is not his only good one.I will compliment all involved on making a movie which still manages to look good despite having a low budget. I've seen pretty bad-looking movies with fairly high budgets (read: Scooby-Doo), but never good-looking movies with low budgets.In the end, The Terminator is a masterful action movie which laid the groundwork for the equally brilliant Terminator 2. If you asked me whether I preferred The Terminator or T2, I would say T2 because I am more familiar with it, otherwise, these two would be on a level footing. If you haven't seen this movie and are an action movie fan, then see it immediately. You won't be disappointed. Trust me.5/5 stars",5
Terminator,"I just saw a horrifying, touching, very good movie again; it's The Terminator.  Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it's an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it's about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman.  That's a theme more movies should have if we want girls to have strong role models.In the course of a few hours during which Sarah Connor realises that she is running for her life from a soul-less machine in human flesh that is implacably and violently determined to kill her, she transforms from a girl who can't balance her cheque book to a woman who can order a wounded, beaten man to ""get on your feet, soldier.""  She is clear-headed, not panicky, focused in crisis and incredibly courageous.  And it's not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that she's grown up.It's relentless, heartless violence appals and fascinates me.  It's gritty depiction of our society as a prelude to an even more horrific one in 2023 darkens my heart.  It's quickly developing love story touches me.  Its humor makes the dark places in me smile.  But most of all I am touched and fascinated by Sarah's precipitous transformation. As a good life exercise, ask yourself this: Would you have the courage to do what she does?9.5 out of 10.",5
Terminator,"For the gift of `Aliens' and `The Terminator' I am willing to forgive Cameron's `Titanic'. The key plot concept is beautifully simple - machines take over the earth in the future. Machines are eventually over thrown by one man. Machines travel back in time to kill man's mother, thus preventing him being born and stopping their own defeat.  One human also travels back to stop the machines from killing his leader's mother.`The Terminator' is a classic good versus evil struggle, with little in the way of greys clouding the issue. The terminator is an unstoppable brutal remorseless killer, and it perfectly suits Arnold Schwarzenegger's limited acting abilities. His few lines, including the infamous `I'll be back' are all well judged and timed, and give a great feeling of precision and inhumanity to his character. Coupled with his chiselled features, he's the best choice for the role. Michael Biehn is playing a character type that he'd reprise two years later in Cameron's `Aliens' - the human tough guy: he's got the fight, but still the ability to love and care for people. His features are well chosen for this and although his delivery of lines is hardly exceptional - they tend to come out in the same tone of voice - he's able to carry his part. Linda Hamilton is the woman-thrown-into-chaos, somewhat reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character in `Alien', although Hamilton doesn't have Weaver's strength of presence. All the actors are, for an action science fiction, above average and so never distract.It's the script, with Cameron's force behind it that lifts the movie from mediocrity. Yes, there's a certain amount of corniness - the `we loved a life time' element for example - but the movie has a real sense of conviction present. The movie believes in itself and, through its passion, will make you believe too. There's a general sense of darkness in the movie - rarely do we see daylight, and, when we do, it's often the soft light of dawn. There's a nice sense of tension in the action scenes, helped not only by Cameron's camera work but also by an excellent electronic score (including a fantastic brooding credit sequence). Sure some of the SFX look clunky in these days of `Attack of the Clones' and `The Fellowship of the Ring', but they still work. There's a certain sense of inevitability, intertwined with hope, permeating the picture that creates a mood I particularly enjoyed and that's harder to find in the current crop of science fiction movies.`The Terminator' is not a perfect picture. The movie lags in some parts, and the romance element is fairly contrived. Despite all that the movie brims with energy and promise, a script that mostly delivers, characters you can enjoy, and the ultimate Arnie role. Well worth catching. 8/10.",0
Terminator,"Terminator is an extremely low budget movie. In fact, just about everything used in it didn't cost much at all, but it is a very effective movie. Back in the '70's and 80's, movies could be very low budget, but still be great(think of John Carpenter's Halloween).The Terminator is a story about how nuclear war causes the end to mankind and the end result could be the start of an even greater tragedy than the war its self. The entire message of The Terminator is an anti nuclear war message.Many people think that a few parts in the beginning of the movie are just some random things thrown in. I can understand why, but these seemingly random scenes actually do have a lot to do with the story.Arnold does a great job as the cyborg who is programmed to kill without mercy or remorse. For those who don't know, this is the movie where the line ""I'll be back"" was spoken. The other actors do a good job in this. Linda Hamilton made a great choice doing this movie and she really improved her career through it(the movie she made before this was the horrible Children Of The Corn).This is better than Terminator 2(which is still great by the way), because this movie has more of a story and is more involved. I would recommend watching this movie at any time, it is very well paced and never gets boring, and if you have the time, watch T2 right after this.",5
Terminator,"Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it's release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.",5
Terminator,"There are actors,and there are movie stars.Arnold Schwarzenegger is without question a movie star,because every time he is on screen, he is,well,Arnold.There is a different Arnold in this film,and this     is what I like about it.He,for once,is playing the villain,and to perfection,I might add.He makes for one of the best screen villains ever in cinema history.It's a pity that his ""good guy"" image won't allow him to play the bad seed more often,but that's Hollywood, I guess.Aside from the thrilling sequel,this is perhaps Arnold's best work.",5
Terminator,"I've reviewed this classic movie before, but now I'm gonna review the DVD. To start, I must say that although they had their rationale for deleting the ""terminated"" scenes, as they were called, I think they definitely should have left that one scene in where Sarah Connor calls her mom and tells her to hide in the cabin, and where she finds the listing of Cyberdyne Corp. in the phone book. This scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other ""terminated"" scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her ""wholesome waitress"" routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly, but it really brought home how foreign our world is to Reese, as did the crying scene. The tickling scene might have seemed silly to the editor, but I thought it really made a point: after all the violence and bleakness Reese lived through, to be with the woman he's always loved and idolized, to lay in a cozy warm bed with her experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time (I still wonder if Sarah devirginized him, since he said he'd ""never"" had any special someone in his life) seemed to bring everything into perspective. The scene where you discover that the factory was Cyberdyne Systems was important too, but I'll let these scenes slide. I really think they should consider releasing a TERMINATOR with the scene in the wooded area included. Nevertheless, I still consider this film as one of my favorite sci-fi films, and my favorite James Cameron film. I still admire who he infuses humanity with action and adrenaline, and the missing scenes were wonderful.",5
Terminator,"The Terminator simply has to be my number 1 favourite movie of all time. When the first time I saw the film I fell in love with it about 15 years ago. The truly original idea of the story-line is amazing about a cyborg is sent from the future on a deadly mission. He has to kill Sarah Connor, a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector - Kyle Reese - also sent from the future. The Terminator uses his exceptional intelligence and strength to find Sarah. The movie was emotionally & psychologically thrilling and made so dark & sinister that give the tensive mood for the film. A well made for 80's film and I was surprised when I heard that it made with a budget of $6.4 million because it looks more expensive e.g. the nuclear war in Los Angeles 2029. I loved every second of it and the best scenes are:1. When the terminator killed Ginger & her boyfriend.2. Shootout at the nightclub (A classic scene in film history).3. Self surgery on his wrist & eye.4. Shootout at the police station.5. When the terminator was driving the lorry.6. When he unexpectedly rose from the fire as an endoskeleton after that it was a nail biting experience to the end.The line ""I'll be back"" is simply the best quote for any film because the audience never expected his position of coming back. Although it is on the IMDb top 250 but it should have been No 1 top place because I have never seen a better movie than this. I've seen it about 100 times and I'm still not fed up. The Terminator gave me the passion about films and my verdict is 1000, 000/10. It's nearly about 25 years old and people still watch it. The 80's was the best decade for movies e.g. An American Werewolf in London, Gremlins, A Nightmare in Elm Street & Predator, the list is endless. Anyway no matter whatever happens there will never be a better film than The Terminator.",5
Terminator,"This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time.This is the one that started it all! Arnold is excellent in it! Linda Hamilton was great! Michael Biehn was very good as the good guy! Paul Winfield was good! Lance Hendrickson played a different character! In their short roles Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were cool! Look for Dick Miller! The acting by the cast is very good! The action scenes are very exciting with lots of gun fire and the special effects are awesome! The music is great! Out of the three Terminator films it is hard to decide which is the best but this one is damn good! In fact its one of the best movies ever! I strongly recommend anyone who loves Arnold and the other cast members I mentioned and especially if you love action, sci-fi, or even horror movies to not rent but buy this classic! I recommend The Terminator!Movie Nuttball's NOTES:There is one scene that I really like in the Terminator! It is when Sarah Connor is at the dance club. What I love about it is the song and the excellent slow motion camera. Its when Sarah drops something, she goes to pick it up and while she is bending over The Terminator comes walking through the dance floor! Its a classic moment!Bill Paxton has been a part of three huge franchises! Being The Terminator as The Punk Leader, Aliens as Pvt. W. Hudson, and Predator 2 as Jerry Lambert! Lance Hendrickson has had a similar way of being in epics like Paxton being in The Terminator as Detective Vukovich, in Aliens as Bishop, Alien 3 as Bishop II, and as Charles Weyland in the upcoming 2004 movie Alien vs. Predator! Hendrickson, believe it or not was the original choice to play The Terminator! It is so amazing about this!By Paxton and Hendrickson being in these films and that Alien Vs. Predator is finally going to invade the theaters in 2004 could it be that this has happened for a reason? The reason possibly being this: In the great Dark Horse comic books there are many editions of Alien Vs. Predator and a edition of Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator! What I am saying is could this mean that Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator will be made into a huge motion picture or a Alien vs. The Terminator or even a Predator vs. The Terminator movie in the future? Its just a thought but what if? I am sure some writers and/or directors have talked about these subjects! I am also sure big fans of these films and of The Terminator would love to watch these icons battle it out!",5
Terminator,"I don't like action movies generally, and had to be coaxed into seeing this one by a friend.  It was a major and pleasant surprise to me, and I left it with questions beyond the scope of the film, which always happens with the ones I really like (ie, Did John know who Reese was/would be when he sent him?).  Most of all, I left it a Michael Biehn fan; he is great in this movie.",4
Terminator,"The 1984 classic, an astounding production. One of Cameron's early works, and yet one of his best. The ultimate thing that puts this film on a whole another level above so many other flops is the awesome blend of realism and atmosphere. When I first saw it as a kid, it just felt so real to me. And now, ten years later,t that feeling hasn't left me. Using his camera in a way only he can do, Cameron instills a sense of dread in every scene, something good old Arnold did quite well.Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton also did extraordinarily so, just putting the right amount of emotional touches to their performances. Its an involving film throughout that never fails to hit hard, even in light of some terrible and CGI loaded sequels. And who could forget the score, which only added to the already excellent tension. My favorite scene? No doubt, in a disturbing way, the scene where the T-101 is repairing itself, and the lighting is just so perfect gives off a feeling of absolute fear. Or perhaps the scene in the club where Reese first engages the Terminator, either way ingenious and unforgettable moments in film history.A classic in every way.",5
Terminator,"Watch it if you haven't.
Watch it if you haven't.

Watch it if you haven't.",5
Terminator,"I don't know if The Terminator is the best sci-fi/action film ever made by anyone, but if it's not...then I don't know what is.I have seen this movie several dozen times since the age of 4, and it just gets better every time. It does have a special place in my heart, so I'll try and be as objective as possible in my review.The plot is not as complicated as it seems. A man from the future is sent to 1984 Los Angeles to protect the mother of the unborn man who will lead the human race in resistance to the machines, who have also sent back a ""terminator"" to kill this woman, named Sarah Conner.What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the fact that it starts going from frame one and doesn't stop until the very end. We first see the terminator come back, kill some punks (Bill Paxon is one of them!) rob a gun store, and proceed to kill everyone in the phone book who has the name Sarah Conner. In the meantime, the man is sent back, chased by the police, steals a shotgun and some homeless guy's clothes, and then looks for Sarah Conner. And when we first see Sarah, she is a fumbling waitress...not ""the mother of the future"".When the terminator, the man (named Kyle Reese), and Sarah Conner all come together, we are treated to one of the paramount action scenes of all time. All three people in the same location and the slow-motion and cheesy 80's music starts up. At this point, anyone who is watching the movie for the first time has no idea who's on who's side. Then the terminator targets Sarah and Kyle interrupts the slow motion with gunfire. After that is a short but effective shoot-out (Uzi 9mm absolutely MUST be used in every 80's action movie), then a vehicle chase while Kyle lays down the exposition.The thing that makes this movie so effective is the antagonist...the terminator. He is shot several times, thrown through a window, hit by a car...and he keeps on going. And I'm sure everyone (even some who have not see the movie) knows the famous line ""I'll be back"", which is said just before the terminator ""visits the police station"", if you know what I mean. At this point, Sarah and Kyle are at the police station, so they're safe, right? ""There's thirty cops in this building"", so they must be safe. Wrong. Five minutes later, everyone is dead and the building is burning to the ground...and the terminator keeps on going.James Cameron's directing is outstanding, especially considering the $6,400,000 budget and the primitive yet effective special effects, which deserve special mention. The effects in this movie are, in parts, better than anything that can be done by today's cgi. Sure, there's many parts which are out-dated as hell, but there's still certain effects that look real enough to believe. The gas truck exploding at the end was a miniature actually exploding, not some fake cgi crap done on a computer. The metal terminator skeleton at the end is real, not a cgi effect (but the stop-motion scenes look AWFUL).Considering the budget in relation to what was accomplished in this film, it's truly a remarkable effort that could probably not have been pulled off by anybody other than James Cameron. Add a script that is commonly used as a teaching tool for upcoming screenwriters and you have a spectacular film.The only bad thing about this movie is that after watching it today, it makes you sad that nobody working today can make anything as good.",5
Terminator,"The people who say Judgement Day is better than The Terminator are wrong. This is soooo good there's no topping it. I liked the entire trilogy a lot, but there's no comparing to this first one. It's a brainless action film, but it's not entirely brainless. Excellent world building makes it fascinating to explore, and begs for the two sequels.Even though it is sort of over the top in all of the action, it's just a really fun movie to see. Greatest pure action movie ever. Period.And Arnold is better as the bad guy. Just sayin'.",5
Terminator,"A great science-fiction film with a compelling story. James Cameron does a good job interweaving a science-fiction narrative with other elements. The movie is considered an independent film with a low budget, but it feels much more than that. The animation for the time is actually done quite well, especially for being a low budgeted film. Linda Hamilton does a great job in the film. She doesn't over act her lines and the end of the film I felt she really outshone in the factory and leaving John her message. Michael Biehn also does a great performance and Arnold Schwarzenegger does a good job, he may of had very few lines but his physical acting is very well done. Schwarzenegger did a good job at portraying a cyborg with use of movements. The dream sequences in the film that go back and forth between the future and the present is amazing, gives it more of a chilling sense knowing that their future is full of hardship and turmoil. Overall this film is amazing and for being 30 years old, is still going to stand the test of time.",5
Jumanji 3,"Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way. That's one of the big attractions of this of film: the excellent combination of adventure and comedy.Are there annoying things in this movie? Sure. To me, it was Bonnie Hunt's occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter (Jonathan Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment!",5
Jumanji 3,"I just used to love ""Jumanji"" as a kid. This was what was Oscar worthy to me, because I loved the special effects and Robin Williams. Even though I think I over did it with the Oscar worthy thoughts, still to this day I enjoy ""Jumanji"". It's a great family film that will make you feel good and have fun with.Robin Williams plays Alan, a boy who when he was little and had a horrible fight with his father plays a game with his friend, Sarah, and the game happens to be cursed causing Alan to get sucked into the game until someone else plays it. Sarah freaking out by just what happened runs home and no one believes her leaving Alan behind for decades in the game. When a new family moves in, Judy and Peter and their Aunt Nora, they find the game and start playing and release Alan who has just survived decades in a jungle. When they realize that they must finish the game to make the horrible curses it brings go away, they find Sarah who is now the town loony, and must play it 'til they finish. But can they do that with all the spiders, elephants, lions, tsunami, vines, stampedes, and an angry hunter? You'll just have to wait and see.This is a great movie for the family and I'd highly recommend it for a good watch. It's just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst. So sit back, grab the popcorn, and enjoy ""Jumanji""! 8/10",4
Jumanji 3,"Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play.  But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must.""Jumanji"" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away.In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter.Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the ""This is MY baby"" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike.",5
Jumanji 3,"There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has.",5
Jumanji 3,"I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind...This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure.Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story.Great!10 out of 10 from me!",5
Jumanji 3,"You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it.Oh and one more thing: from ""Jumanji"", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles.",4
Jumanji 3,"This is the kind of movie that i would still like to watch even after 23 years, its unpredictable , you'll never know what to expect, ending was not what i expected it could have been a bit more exciting , but overall still a classic",5
Jumanji 3,"This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!",5
Jumanji 3,"In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called ""Jumanji"" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. ""Jumanji"" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jumanji""",4
Jumanji 3,"I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie.",5
Jumanji 3,"I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and ""Jumanji"" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life.",5
Jumanji 3,"Unhappy young Alan disappears while playing creepy board game Jumanji. Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off.This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children.All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania.Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.",5
Jumanji 3,I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was.The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done.This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.,4
Jumanji 3,"One of the best 90's child's movie. Includes adventure, humor and love.
The plot heightens the intensity of the jungle by bringing a board game to actual life, with really good special effects for a 90's film.
Robin Williams is amazing as always and his role also symbolizes the struggling bond between father and son and overcoming fear.
I'm thrilled that my kids loved the movie the same way i did when I was in their age.",5
Jumanji 3,I really enjoy this film. The only reason that I gave it 9 stars instead of ten was because it slightly scared me and I'm not a huge fan of that. Regardless it's a great film with amazing actors and wonderful message. Makes me miss Robin a lot!,5
Jumanji 3,"This movie took me back to my childhood, fortunately for me, my journey was not cumber sum as Alan's. the movie reminded me of the fun we had watching the movie with our cousin and enjoying the fantasy of a magical board game. the movie also made me realise that what a marvellous actor Robin Williams was. it saddened me that a person who spread happiness could come to an unfortunate end.",5
Jumanji 3,"Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good.There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid.With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him.Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him.What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film.Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.",5
Jumanji 3,"Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game.'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good.Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up!",5
Jumanji 3,"I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley.I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it!",5
Jumanji 3,"Another of my favorite childhood movies, there is Jumanji,one of my favorite movies with Robin Willians and Kirsten Dunst. Alan Parrish is a rich boy and his family were the founders of the city of New England, where the boy and his family lives. Not only that, his father is a businessman who has lots of deals and one of them is the notable shoe factory. But Alan life is not so good as we think: he is having problems with her best friend Sarah's boyfriend and his gang and his father wants to send him to a boarding school. Angry, he says to his father that he is never going to talk to him again and will ran away from his home. But when Alan was going to scape from his house, his friend Sarah goes to his house to talk, and they end up playing the mysterious game called Jumanji that Alan found buried. The strange game starts, and many strange things like wild animals start to show up, until Alan enter the game and be confined there until the results of the dice be 5 or 8. Sarah, too afraid to continue playing,run away. After 26 years,two brothers named Judy and Peter found the game and start playing it, like Sarah and Alan 26 years ago. Peter takes 5 in the dice, what makes Alan turn back after many years. Now they need to finish the game in order to all the horrible results end, but first Alan needs to find Sarah and convince her to play the spooky game again.",4
Jumanji 3,"Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. ""Jumanji"" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.",4

The Call Of The Wild,"I don't know about other people, although looking at the score this website has given this film I can only ponder, but when it comes to international team work in making a film, I often love the results. In fact, I loved this movie and thought it was extraordinary. Oh and the emotion, it blew me away. 'Call Of The Wild' is a very emotional story of a German Sheppard's forced journey from 19th Century California to the Goldrush of the Alaskan wilderness and the meeting with its new owner with which it becomes closer to than with anyone or anything else. A very simple story indeed, but the legendary Jack London knew how to tell a great high adventure tale on an epic scale and he obviously fancied dogs very much as is shown with his minute details about his subjects. I believe that Ken Annakin (the director of this film) realized London's vision to perfection and translated it brilliantly to the screen.The sheer realism that Jack London told his stories with takes you to another world and it takes your breath away with their uplifting finales. Ken Annakin had done a wonderful job with directing ""Call Of The Wild"". The dog in the film is an actor itself as it plays such an integral part of the film. Not even half way into it, it is almost certain that you will fall in love with the dog. Its emotions and gestures are all natural, and it's easy to relate to the dog's journey. Five minutes into the film, I was hooked. The dog had such a commanding presence that not even Charlton Heston could get in its way. And then there is Charlton Heston, a man of such phenomenal, legendary influence on film history. Yet even with his power, fame and success he is one of the few actors in the world who's fame doesn't distract from the film. It's his strong presence and every-man, human and subtle performances that set him apart from many actors on the same level of fame. He is always the same 'Chuck', but he is more like we are and that's why we loved his films so much. So, when you see him inevitably getting closer and attached to the dog, it feels so convincing and real, it drains you of all emotions. Call me crazy, but when the credits at the end were rolling I felt like crying. Here you are, in the middle of god's nowhere in the heart of the Alaskan wilderness; two mammals - a dog and a man - who have no families and nothing to come home to find one another and become the closest, most reliant friends as it is a key player in their survival of the unforgiving hardships of the Goldrush and the wilderness in between them and the Gold. The scenes where 'Chuck' finds the dog after not seeing him for a long time are so uplifting and you can see the happiness and joy in Heston's eyes. However, nothing beats the finale when the dog and the man are departed for the last time in tragedy. It's so sad and it makes you think about how big their journey together was and how close they were to one another. Yet, the film still finishes on a positive note with the dog and his offspring symbolizing ""life goes on"".What really set the mood for the film more than the harsh wilderness and the hardships that the two faced throughout, was the unusual, alienating music written and composed by Carlo Rustichelli, which at first seems out of place and very weird, but soon becomes the film's underlying haunting atmosphere and power. In a way, the music paints a picture of struggle and isolation better than anything I've ever heard in my life. By the end of the film, I didn't want anything else, it was perfect. And of course, the music wouldn't have been any good without the wonderful cinematography that gave a clear realization of how vast the landscape is.Ken Annakin's ""Call Of The Wild"" is easily a worthy addition to the adventure lover's film collection. You will feel like you have been on an epic journey. It captures the importance of dogs in those times - for dogs were at times worth more than Gold as they were the only things that could get you around the deep snows of Alaska. Rarely have I seen such a realistic and graphically harsh portrayal of the Goldrush years and the men with their dogs and sleds that fought, searched and died for the Gold. And in the fore-front there is a most captivating story about love and friendship between two different species. Adventure fans, go no further than this great escapist master work. Yes, there is wooden acting in some parts, but the core of the film doesn't fail one bit. The film is a definite product of the 70s and adds a lot of nostalgia, only adding to the atmosphere. I absolutely surrendered to the film's beauty and power and I can confidently call it a classic. They don't make em' like this anymore!",5
The Call Of The Wild,"Charlton Heston as John plays a prospector along with Raimund Harmstorf . They are at the right time and in the right location to live numerous adventures . The picture chronicles the Gold Rush days of Alaska from Klondike territory and in the Dawson City center . Heston finds and befriends a German shepherd dog called Buck which saves and protects to John and his partner . The dog rescues them from dangers and leads throughout snowy landscapes . But Buck is robbed and is taken by various masters , being forced to pull a snow sled.The movie is based on Jack London novel -in part autobiographic but in his real life was prospector- , narrating the story about the gold discovery , people came to find the precious mineral through the freeze ways and corruption , violence and ambition that came with them . Authentic stars film are the animals as there appear : Huskys , pack of wolves and of course the magnificent German shepherd named Buck . The best of the movie are the marvelous , spectacular snowy outdoors , being stunningly photographed by John Cabrera in places as Finland , Norway and Spain . Atmospheric , evocative score by the Italian composer Carlo Rustichelli . The picture is one of various renditions based on Jack London novels along with  The White Fang  , creating the sub-genre about the Alaska adventures . The film is a European co-production by Harry Alan Towers with actors of several nations ( German as Raimund Harmstorf ; French as Michele Mercier ; English as Maria Rohm ; Spanish as Juan Luis Galiardo , Sancho Gracia and Italian as George Eastman or Luigi Montefiori). Charlton Heston said about this one resulted to be his worst film but I think is entertaining and watchable although mediocre for its poor direction and weak plot which hamper this familiar story .",3
The Call Of The Wild,"Call of the Wild, The (1972) *** (out of 4) A house dog is stolen from its owner and sold to a group of men who abuse him and eventually sell him as a sled dog. The sled owner (Charlton Heston) soon grows attached to the dog and we see their adventures in Alaska, which includes hunting for gold. This version of the famous story isn't as good as the 1935 version with Clark Gable and Loretta Young but this one does remain entertaining throughout. There are some major problems with the film that keeps it from being great but even through there are problems there's still a wonderfully touching movie here. What doesn't work is that the film really appears to have originally been three hours and then edited down to its 100-minute running time. I say this because there seems to be some rough editing and there are various parts of the film that seem rushed. This becomes rather annoying but the real star here is the dog. The dog used in the film does a remarkable job and really makes his role a real character and not just an animal doing tricks. Heston gives a pretty good performance and his actions with the dog are a lot of fun to watch but there are moments when the actor goes over the top and brings a few laughs, which certainly wasn't intended. Michele Mercier is good as Heston's lover and George Eastman makes for a great villain. The film was shot in Finland, which leads to some terrific visuals and the movie remains entertaining all the way through. The love story between Heston and his dog is beautifully captured but some should be warned that there are a lot of scenes of animal abuse, which will certainly bother some.",0
The Call Of The Wild,"This is definitely a European-style film from the period, the 70s. Everything about it speaks loudly with the European influence, the music, the cinematography, the editing. It's much like what you'd see in countless Euro horror films from the time, but this time it's a dramatic and rather realistic take on the old American classic. When seen, it doesn't take much to imagine the shooting conditions, and how did they all, cast and crew, put up with the misery of the terrible cold and snow? Heston isn't miscast here like some say, he's just very much different from what might be expected, but he does an admirable job. Some of his best film work was during this time, not the studio blockbusters he was known for prior to this. It is good that the story doesn't opt for the Hollywood ""happy ending"" but, without spoiling it for those who haven't seen this, it is a much more realistic ending.",0
The Call Of The Wild,"As the only name we American viewers will recognize in the cast, Charlton Heston does very well in the lead role of John Thornton rugged prospector in the Klondike Gold Rush. There are two leads of course, the other being Buck the lead sled dog that Heston puts more store in than most people.It's not a misanthropic position by any means. As anyone who lives in the frozen north on any continent, a good sled dog is still the best transportation around. One that is loyal and smart like Buck is worth more than the gold he might carry out of a strike.The only other version I saw of this story is the one that starred Clark Gable and Loretta Young in the Thirties, That one took considerable liberties with the story. This version is faithful to Jack London's novella which came out when folks were still panning for gold in this area in 1902.You'll not know any other names from the cast except possibly French actress Michele Mercier who plays a saloon owner in Dawson City and who would like Heston to settle down with her. But The Call Of The Wild is as strong in him as it is in Buck The Dog who discovers his second cousin the wolf and yearns for their open existence. Though the dog develops an affection for his human the same way Heston has for the dog.Heston is rugged and fine in the lead role. The non-recognition of the other players works out because it lends an air of authenticity to the film. Ken Annakin's direction is on target and the location cinematography done in the Lapland country of Norway and Finland is magnificent.Heston wasn't crazy about the film, I imagine it was one rugged location shoot for him. Still his fans should like it and I can tell you he's done worse films than The Call Of The Wild.",4
The Call Of The Wild,"I saw this movie when I was about 11 years old. I didn't expect anything from it and was very happily surprised. Obviously low budget, this is offset by the authentic looking town, beautiful locations, Hestons great acting and Jack Londons timeless classic. It for me is one of my favorites, and I would recommend it to anyone. Even though the dialogue seems to be dubbed here and there I didn't have a problem with it. How Buck ends up in Alaska and is saved by Heston sets the tone for their unique friendship! Heston must decide which path to take, as Buck must decide as well! This is definitely a story of fate and of personal choices ending with a desperate and dramatic climax! I read some of the other reviews ans it seems most people don't like this film. I don't care, I was able to overlook the dubbing and the other flaws mentioned simply because this movie looks like the Yukon in the latter half of the 19th century. The story is touching and excuse me, but i like it. When you have Heston it makes up for a lot............",4
The Call Of The Wild,"***SPOILERS*** At the beginning of the movie we see this handsome and powerful German Shepherd leading a wolf pack as they run down and kill a caribou for their supper. Later looking under the icy river the dog sees his master frozen to death beneath it; The dog's name is Buck the master is John Thornton, Charlton Heston. The story of Buck and how he became the leader of a wolf pack in the Yukon territory starts some time back in the sunny climate of Santa Clara Calif. It's 1897 and gold was discovered around the Klondike River in the Yukon and Alaskan territory's up north and dogs like Buck were worth their weight in gold as sled dogs in that country's deep snows and freezing weather. Dognaped by Judge Miller's, Alfredo Mayo, gardener Manuel for a price of $75.00 Buck was well on his way from being a sweet and loving pet to becoming a strong and ferocious wild animal. Beaten and broken for weeks by a number of different owners of sled-dog teams Buck was almost dead when he was bought and put into the service of John Thorrnton and his partner Pete's, Ralmund Harmstorf, dog team. With John & Pete's kind and tender handling of him Buck became the lead sled dog and the most powerful and at the same time feared dog in the Yukon territory. Buck led the dog team in covering the treacherous 600 mile journey from Skaguay to Dawson as the lead sled-dog for John & Pete in record time when no other dog team and it's owners would dare to try it. In the movie Buck is stolen a number of times from John, and was once almost shot and killed by the local bootlegger, but Buck always managed to escape and return home to John & Pete. It's later that the dog begins to yarn for his home in the wild. The reason Buck didn't go back to the woods, where he developed a strong friendship with the local Timber Wolves in the area, was his love for and loyalty to the persons who saved his life John & Pete. Torn between his two kind and caring human masters and his wolf family Buck can't quite bring himself to break away from civilization to live in the wild. Later one night a band of local Indians attack the cabin where both John & Pete were staying in and ended up killing both of them. Buck and his wolf pack tried to come to their rescue but were too late to save them as we saw in the beginning of the movie. With the two persons who Buck had a mutual bond with now gone Buck can now return to his distant descendants, the wild wolves, in the dark and cold woods of the Klondike. Buck, in th end, ended up answering to something that he understood and that was ingrained in his consciousness from the thousands of generations of canines over millions of years that he eventually evolved from: The Call of the Wild.",4
The Call Of The Wild,"For a dog-lover, it is a moving and heart-touching story. For any other viewer, it is an old movie that features a bunch of sled dogs and Alaska. You really must read the book by Jack London before seeing the film. It follows the plot but it does confuse matters.The dog stunts do look very real and do tend do worry you. Fortunatly, you are assured before the movie begins that no animals were harmed in the making of the film. It was good quality for the time period with well-trained animals and nice camera shots. The soundtrack could have been improved but works for the general atmosphere. I was also disappointed by Buck's appearance. He was a German Shepherd mix as described in the book but was presented as a Newfoundland in the film. Curly was also the wrong breed. None of this honestly mattered once the film got started.It is no match for Disney's White Fang but Call of the Wild does come as its infamous partner.",4
The Call Of The Wild,"Well, this is a typical 1970's-era film, with lots of suspicious animal action which makes you feel glad that films today are shot under the auspices of the ASPCA and the Humane Society.  Shot under horrifyingly rough conditions, with Norway standing in for the Yukon, the film takes few liberties with Jack London's classic novel, but the bizarre casting of Charlton Heston as John Thornton makes the viewer want to scratch their head.  Jaggedly edited and with a greater budget for snow than special effects, the viewer is implored to suspend belief as animal after animal is torn apart and shown drenched with fake blood, looking bewildered. Obviously, as befitting a movie of this era, the hordes of unwashed gold prospectors are as grungy a bunch as ever filmed, but the few women who surface are as impeccably dressed and made up as any model in a Vanity Fair shoot.  Lots of bad sound and snow on the lens, but a nice job at portraying one man and one dog who love one another fiercely.  Peculiar film, lots of cute dogs, lots of atrocious acting, and lots and lots and lots of snow.",3
The Call Of The Wild,"Jack London's The Call of the Wild is a perennial educational classic which is used in public schools today across the United States. Charlton Heston's character John Thornton at first is a real hard head in the beginning as a man bound and determined to find ""Old Yellow Moon"" which is a gold mine fortune deep in Yukon Indian Territory. His hateful attitude towards Buck at first is intolerable but as the relationship between man and dog builds Thornton's hardheadedness gives way to love and devotion.The copyright to this movie keeps falling in and out every video labels hands just about every year or so. The transfer is horrendous as it has no doubt been transferred from a first generation video tape print over and over again to it's current DVD print. Personally I wish The Weinstien Brothers Bob and Harvey would buy out the copyright to this movie and all of it's film elements and get this movie fully restored on their Miriam Collection DVD Label in a 1 or 2 disc Special Edition featuring any extras that might actually exist somewhere in some film vault waiting to be discovered.",3
The Call Of The Wild,"By far the best dog movie ever made. Excellent acting, one of the best all time endings. To give this movie a bad review you would have to be a video game playing fool or never stepped foot in the northern woods. I've watched this movie several times with many people and anyone who saw it thought it was great. Set with a historical background into the Yukon it gives you a realistic understanding about dog sledding. Great background about Indian myths and panning for gold. The movie does have a low budget,however it does doesn't need special effects. It's one of the great American stories about a deep friendship between a man and his best friend. If you want non-stop action and special effects go watch the Terminator instead.",5
The Call Of The Wild,"I had watched this as a kid on Italian TV; like TREASURE ISLAND (1972), it was a holiday favorite and did, in fact, remember the death scene of the Charlton Heston character after all these years! I've only watched the 1935 Clark Gable film (just announced on DVD) once but this one, an international production as opposed to a studio product, results in being the inferior version. As such it's watchable but uninspired, and quite scrappily made; the location shooting, however, is a big plus - as is Carlo Rustichelli's score. Heston is commanding as ever, but the real stars of the picture are the dogs - which are featured in some pretty violent footage for a film based on a children's classic (by Jack London).The rest of the cast is nothing special (George Eastman's villain is especially ludicrous), though both Michele Mercier and Maria Rohm (in yet another film produced by her husband Harry Alan Towers, who also co-wrote under his customary alias Peter Welbeck) are certainly attractive; still, the latter's shrill performance here demonstrates once again that it took a Jess Franco to offer her some worthy, meaty roles (particularly VENUS IN FURS [1968] and EUGENIE...THE STORY OF HER JOURNEY INTO PERVERSION [1969])!",3
The Call Of The Wild,"Have you ever gotten one of those inexpensive DVD collections of movies? The kind with about 4 DVD's to the box and most of the movies included are just really bad or so bad they make you laugh? In the case of ""The Call Of The Wild"",it's hard to say which category it falls in of those two. A fair amount of this movie is is just plain dull. In terms of (as someone mentioned) the endless outdoor snow & dog sled scenes. I think there was nearly a half hour of this,or at least it felt like it. The almost non-stop barking of the dogs and just gosh-awful music playing over the scenes, got to be annoying as well.I found the kidnapping of the dog to be completely senseless. It's taken from a California family and I asked myself, ""Did they not have pet stores to buy a dog back then?"" The dog-napper could have bought a dog and sold it for more.I understand from the beginning that the main character is the German Shepard. Even more so when the ,all too real looking, abusive scenes of animal cruelty are shown. To make it more obvious of the Shepard being the main character, a good idea would have been to get a lesser known actor than Heston. He's always been larger than life on screen no matter what he's been in,so of course,people think that he's the main character.Interseting to see Heston so devoted to the dog and it's well being,much like it's a better friend to him than the humans he knows and hunts for gold with. In reference to those characters,they are the kind I've seen in many films before,more so Westerns. You have the drunken mobs,either in the saloon or the street and of course the big chested female who is the entertainment but pretty much runs the place. She even gives Heston a bath!Then there's the guy who hates the dog and Heston and wants the dog killed because of being (deservedly) bitten by the dog. Heston's buddy talks the man into a wager that if the dog call pull 500 pounds via dog sled,on his own,for 100 yards,then the dog gets to live. Of course the dog pulls it successfully,after the initial struggle.Near the end is a very senseless Indian attack on Heston and his one remaining partner who've finally discovered gold. Killing them both and Heston winds face up underwater.with the dog looking down at him helplessly. The overall point here,is ""what's the point of this film?"" Maybe if the look and sound were all restored to a better quality I could understand it and enjoy it better? If the acting and direction had not been so bland? Probably not. I can only say that,seeing Heston work with the Shepard , the German Shepard's ""acting"" and the incredible scene of the thundering,circling herd were the most interesting things shown here. I can,for these 3 things only,give the movie two stars. (END)",1

The Call Of The Wild,"I just saw this movie - it was very hard to follow (and I had read the book), lots of gory dog fights with blood, language not suitable for kids, the dubbing was out of sync, the VHS quality was very grainy. Charlton Heston (""My dog doesn't like the way you smell"")could not pull this version of Jack London's classic out of the cold - though his parts were done fine. The movie could have been shortened to improve the pace - there was too much time spent on snow scenes and characters gazing at each other. It is certainly not worth purchasing - I got it for free as a giveaway. The ending is confusing as if a scene were missing - Heston ends up under ice in a lake. Buck then romps off with the wolves. Bottom line - View another version of this classic story.",2
The Call Of The Wild,"I'm only in the 8th grade and watched this movie in class after analyzing the actual book. The movie was not bad, but could be done better. None of the dogs matched the description in the book, and the characters were awfully mismatched. ""Who is Calliope!?!"" was a question many of my classmates asked themselves. The plot events were put and moved around much like a scrapbook. BTW, Call of the Wild is not a children's book!! It is actually a book with dark themes, much like most of his other books. If you don't know how to read and comprehend classic literature, I suggest you go back to reading a true children's book: The Cat in the Hat.",3
The Call Of The Wild,"If you've read the book it's not a spoiler.This movie doesn't work because too much focus is put on Charlton Heston. He's up in the Arctic, falling in love, delivering mail, and you begin to think that he is the main character. But in actuality, the dog is the main character. Jack London makes this clear. The story stays on Buck, the dog, throughout the whole book. While this movie does center on Buck, most of the movie also centers on Thornton, Heston's character.In the book, Buck is stolen from his home in California and sold up north, where sled dogs sell for top dollar. Buck is beaten and abused, but unlike most pets sold as sled dogs, Buck survives and grows strong. In the end, Buck is so mistreated and abused he can barely stand. This is when his one good master, and last master, Thornton, rescues him. They thrive together. But Buck keeps feeling the 'call of the wild,' but he wouldn't leave his beloved master. Eventually, Thornton is killed, and Buck answers the 'call of the wild.' With this story, it's obvious that the dog is the main character. After all, Thornton is only in the end, and he dies.But in this movie, Thornton is too much of a main character, and when he dies in the end, as he must, for the movie is, ""The Call of the Wild,"" it leaves one angry at the movie if you haven't read the book and aren't expecting it.Aside from this, weird, creepy music plays throughout the whole film. The acting is mediocre and not terribly enjoyable. At this time, in the North, there were no airplanes or anything. If you wanted to get anywhere, it was either by boat or dogsled. There were dogs everywhere. At one point, Thornton and his team mush into a town where there are no sled dogs (so his dogs are stolen). This is absolutely ridiculous. A superior sled dog team may be stolen, but to find a town with no sled dogs?!? Ludicrous!Not one of Charlton Heston's best films. The dogs aren't given the best roles, but they are still a joy to watch.",4
The Call Of The Wild,"If you're looking for a classic piece of literature transferred to film, and you see this 1972 ""version"" of Jack London's classic on the kiddies' shelf at the library (no self-respecting video store should stock this thing), move on. This is, quite simply, the most incompetent film I've ever seen.I'm not sure if it's the wooden acting, the muddy dubbing, the pinking-shears editing, the outtake-quality colors, or the lack of any relationship between the plot in the book and the movie, but my only question for the people who made this Mystery Science Theatre 3000-grade garbage is, ""Were you aware you were making cinematic doggy poo?"" After reading the book, my seventh-grade English class was very interested in seeing a film version of the book. It didn't take long for one of the more eloquent 13 year olds to ask, ""Can Jack London's family sue the people who made this movie?"" I wanted to say, ""Yes, a class action lawsuit!""",0
The Call Of The Wild,"All in all it felt like a made for TV flick.  The greatest moment of the story and other movie versions, is the prospectors crossing the lake, however, here we hear a woman scream then see a close up of her going under. Big disappointment.  The director should have played that up, but with the budget the movie could have done worse.The editing was jagged and tended to distract from the flow of the movie. Chuck Heston is good in it and even if you dont like him you should watch it just to see him willingly give up his firearm in one scene.  It was an enjoyable adaptation and worth the $2.99 I paid for the DVD.",5
The Call Of The Wild,"Several years ago, I rode the White Pass and Yukon Railway from Skagway, Alaska, to Carcross, Yukon, Canada. The 68-mile line through the Coast Range Mountains follows the first leg of the route taken by nearly 100,000 people who ""rushed"" to the gold fields of the Yukon, Klondike and Alaska. The great gold rush that goes by all three names began in 1896 and ended in 1899. Jack London's book, The Call of the Wild, came out in 1903, and was set mainly in that time and place. But his setting didn't have a railway or highways  which had not yet been built. The only way to Dawson City, the goal of the rushers, was overland on foot for most people, and by dog sled for the more fortunate. Today, one can get a sense of the extreme difficulty and hardships of the gold seekers, by taking a trip on the narrow-gage railway that was begun in 1898 and completed in 1900. Although the gold rush ended abruptly, the railway and later Klondike Highway from Skagway remained the principal means of supplies for the Yukon Territory well past the mid-20th century. The railway today thrives mostly on tourist trade. The trip to Carcross is a popular shore excursion for cruise ships that sail to Alaska and stop at Skagway. Check out YouTube for video segments on this rail trip. I mention all of this because I think it adds to one's sense of the challenge and struggle of the people of that time. I remember reading London's book way back in high school (a few decades ago). While the dog, Buck, is the central hero of the book, the story was also much about the human travail of the gold rush. This film does a good job of showing the human foibles, errors of judgment and lack of sense among people who caught the gold ""fever."" Of course, Buck and the other dogs and wolves, are a big part of the film. The scenery and sets are excellent. I can see how the film-makers used locales in Norway for scenes that look almost exactly like early newspaper photos of the gold rush. The acting, cinematography and sets are all top drawer in ""The Call of the Wild."" The weakness in the film is in the script, direction and editing. And, I'm not sure yet, on the musical score. These aspects were choppy at times. Too often, we would have a sudden break in scenes, with no transition. Closer attention to these details could have made this an outstanding film. But for the story it tells from the book, and the scenery, sets and acting, I give it 8 stars. For its historical value and realism, ""The Call of the Wild"" ranks among a few very good films about hardships and struggles with nature. That was not the main plot London had in mind, but the film serves up that secondary plot very well.If you ever take an Alaskan cruise that stops at Skagway, be sure to take the White Pass and Yukon Railway trip to Carcross. A barbecue lunch is at the Yukon end, and you return by bus on the Klondike Highway. It only operates during the summer months. It's a bit costly, but well worth it. This rail line is a major historical and engineering shrine today. Skagway also has a fine museum on the gold rush, and the U.S. National Park Service has a Yukon Gold Rush museum in downtown Seattle.",4
The Call Of The Wild,"If you have read the book and are looking for that same story to unfold on the silver screen, keep looking. This is a very ""60's"" adaptation of a raw and emotionally powerful book. To say the acting is ""wooden"" is an understatement. Most of the ""spaghetti westerns"" had more believable characters than this movie.In the book you journey with Buck from his ranch in California to his ultimate return to the wild. In the movie, Buck is little more than a supporting character with the focus entirely on the human side of the story.I would suggest re-reading the book instead of watching this movie, you will get much more out of the experience. If you do watch the movie, set you expectations low and you won't be disappointed...too much.",1
The Call Of The Wild,"Because you don't see things through buck""s point of view much of the character development is missing. If you're looking for the best movie version though, this one would win",3
Hera Pheri ,"Priyadarshan has a habit of making either extremely boring movies or extremely colourful ones, and I am happy to say that this is one of his finer efforts. This movie is a fun ride from start to finish. The characters are well projected and have a solid background, but more importantly the storyline is well written without flaws, which makes this clean comedy. Bravo Priyadarshan!!!PS:Never thought someone would give a leading role to Paresh RawalI give it a 9/10",0
Hera Pheri ,"Hera Pheri is a film set in Mumbai and is not your run of the mill slapstick comedy that directors like David Dhawan indulge in. The movie is directed by Priyadarshan who proved that after making such wonderful and serious film like Virasat, he can also direct a comedy with lan.This film is a comedy of error. Set in a Mumbai slum where our three protagonists dwell, the movie depicts the hilarious moments created by the simplicity and/or stupidity of the characters. The look of the film is that of an art film. By the look of it, it seems as if it is going to be a really serious movie but it turns out to be one roller-coaster ride of laughter. The cast of the film includes Sunil Shetty who plays an unemployed guy who comes to Mumbai looking for work and a place to live. He lands up at the house of a simple man played deftly by Paresh Rawal who takes Sunil in. However, there is another person living in the house, namely Raju. Played by Akshay Kumar, Raju is the mischief monger and good for nothing. He keeps on getting jobs and losing them quickly. The story is taken forward by a phone call by the gangster Kabira who keeps on saying that he has kidnapped his grand daughter (sunil takes the call) and wants ransom. This call kickstarts a mayhem. Which ultimately leads us to the climax of the film where the protagonists end up becoming millionaires. Each and every member of the cast is brilliant in the performance of their roles. Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar's careers were in doldrums when this film released and both of them gave a stunning performance. Especially Akshay Kumar shows impeccable comic timing. Akshay Kumar is considered of the best comic actors of Bollywood these days after performing comic roles in films like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Khakee, Aawara Paagal Deewana and Waqt. However, the show stealer is none other that the unbelievable Paresh Rawal who plays Baburao Ganpatrao Apte. He is an absolute delight to watch. It will be an understatement to say that he completely overshadows the rest of the actors with his marvellous portrayal of a poor Mumbaiyya simpleton. This film changed the course of his career and he is now reckoned as a character actor who adds to the star value of a film. The music is not that good though. The song ""Main Ladka Pom Pom"" is hilarious though. The picturization keeps you in splits even though the song is irritating if you only listen to the audio. The real hero of the film is the dialogue writer Neeraj Vohra who comes up with some never before heard one liners. Anyone who wants another example of his great work must watch Aawara Paagal Deewana. In short, a film for every comedy lover. Some clean entertainment. Moreover, I can confidently say that this is the best comedy film i have seen in my life. Brilliant!",5
Hera Pheri ,"I never expected much from this movie, because of the cast: Fading Sunil Shetty, sabseboringKhiladi/monkeyboy Akki and serious Tabu. The only hope i had was in Paresh Rawal. After seeing him in the hilarious Andaz Apna Apna (Highly recommended), he was to be taken notice of.So when I did watch it I was shocked to say the least. I found Hera Pheri to be one the best comedies of the decade. Just forget about the cheap attempts of David Dhawan called comedy. This is the real deal.The story is simple (as is with many good movies). The 3 protagonists Shyam (Sunil Shetty), Raju (Akshay Kumar) and Babu Rao (Paresh Rawal) are all in dire need of money. Shyam needs it to pay back an old friend (Om Puri) so he can get his(as in Puri's) sister married. Raju needs it for his mother and Babu Rao to pay back loans his father took. When a local rich man's grand daughter gets kidnapped by 'dangerous' gangster Kabira (Gulshan Grover) calls Babu Rao's number by mistake, Raju sees an end to all their problems. He suggests they play a game, do some hera pheri. And the movie is off to take you for an awesome ride.Performances by far surprised me. Sunil Shetty I never liked, but his performance as the somewhat naive do-gooder was wonderful. Akki ape also surprised me in his sense of comedic timing. But Paresh was the biggest surprise. Even though he was my only hope for this movie, he came out ten times better than I expected. He deserved the best comedian Filmfare Award, that he did receive for 2000. Tabu (Anu) as another person in need of money who fights with Shyam for a job is also competent. It is a small role but as always she leaves her mark. Asrani in a tiny role also gives some laughs. Om Puri was also excellent in his small role.So Bravo Priyadarshan saheb! Once again you've shown that you are a unique and intelligent filmmaker with a lot of tricks up your sleeve. One tip though, don't think too much about the logic of the story or the probability. Just turn off your brain for a few hours and enjoy. You'll find yourself cracking up every time you think of ""Kabira speaking"". Watch the movie and you'll know what I mean.",5
Hera Pheri ,"Talk of comedy in Indian cinema , and anybody would snap ""Hera Pheri"". This is one of the movies which make a permanent imprint on your mind and give you a lot to talk about. With snappy dialogs , impeccable story and a perfect combination of actors and actresses this is certainly a must see. With Indian cinema being crippled by the ""HIGH"" emotional dramas containing stories of ultimate suffering of impossible proportions, Hera Pheri was the turning point, where all the bollywood film industry saw the power of a simple comedy. Starring Paresh Rawal, Suniel Shetty , Akshay Kumar , Tabu , Asrani, Om Puri , Gulshan Grover Hera Pheri had all the ingredients of a super hit. If you hate Indian movies and are against all the high melodrama dose you get free with a DVD of Indian movie, Hera Pheri is just the movie for you. With a sequel now being aired ""Phir Hera Pheri"" which is too good for a sequel. Go watch both of these movies and have a big laugh.",5
Hera Pheri ,"This along with Andaz Apna Apna are my most favorite Bollywood Comedy Movies. Every time I watch Heara Pheri I just can't stop laughing. The first time I watched it I couldn't sleep most of that night because I just continued to laugh on my bed.10 on 10 for me. Although I enjoyed other comedy movies of Priyadarshan like Hungama, Hulchul & Garam Masala and thought those were no less than Hera Pheri, but later when I watched those again they were not so funny as Hera Pheri. Akshay Kumar's acting was great but Paresh Rawal with his character Babu Rao is the one who steals the show, Sunil Shetty, Tabu and Om Puri also played their parts well.Hera Pheri I believe is a milestone in Bollywood because it showed that you don't always need a emotional romantic/patriotic movie to produce a Hit Movie. This movie started a much needed trend of Bollywood Comedies that relied more on stories, errors and confusions for its fun element breaking away from those clich slapstick comedies of David Dhawan starring Govinda. However the sequel to this movie Phir Hera Pheri I must say was disappointing, the first half was OK but the second half was really poor especially the circus scenes. That movie I guess lacked the Priyadarshan touch . Anyways there are talks about a third version of Hera Pheri and that I hope will be as funny as this one.BTW this movie is a remake of a Southern Movie...So those who have a problem with remakes and also those who lack a Sense of Humor should stay away.",5
Hera Pheri ,You won't believe it but it is true that I have seen this movie 17 times and I am still not tired of watching. I saw it on the theatres first and I loved it and then I bought it on DVD. This movie rocks. I love the performance of Paresh Rawal. Akshay kumar and sunil shetty also gives great performances. This movie really makes me laugh. My rating- 10/10,5
Hera Pheri ,"Wow, This is what I call a great comedy in 2-3 hours, it will make you laugh as you are suppose to laugh.  Great acting by Paresh Rawal will make you feel that he is the best for the role given to him and he did justice with what has been given to him.  Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar has done there part very good, but I think the crown for the movie goes to Paresh Rawal.A good movie, with good story and excellent comedy.  Its a must watch for people who like to enjoy there spare time.",0
Hera Pheri ,"From the first scene itself, you start laughing and keep until 'The End'. Strong performances by paresh, akshay and (even) sunil. excellent screenplay and a tight story. even the scenes like two highly desperate (sunil and tab) and unemployed struggling to secure a job inside a bank leave us laughing. Priyadarshan is really a brilliant director, crafting hilarious characters and instances from daily life. just to remind with a dialog: /*not include because written in Hindi and not accepted as spelling mistakes by IMDb*/(in English: a tenant beats up his landlord like a dog'(landlord babu Bahia alerted) 'reason - girls, babu Bahia, girls) and not to forget, nicely woven songs like 'denewala jab bhi data, deta chap par fa-ad K' add to the movie experience.",5
Hera Pheri ,"A movie is funny, when you can laugh at Om Puri. In fact he brings more laughs than the main characters. I could easily compare him to Robert De Nero, who excelled in ""Analyze Me"" and he never envisioned himself as a funny actor. The script is superb and the laughter is infectious with the venerable master of comedy, Paresh Rawal, at the helm. Akshay Kumar, who is other wise pathetic in serious roles, makes a good team with the muscle man Shetty, whose acting skills, are in the same range as Kumar's! After ""Padosan"" there has been some sprinkling of comedy, more like buffoonery, with the likes of Aaamir Khan, Johnny Lever and Shakti Kapoor, whose comedy interludes appeal to the ""sophisticated front bencher's"" who like fart jokes and toilet humor and Anti-Indian and demeaning humor produced by the ""Benchods of Bollywood"" as in films like ""Three Idiots"", ""Delhi Belly"" etc. The front benchers like filth since they live in the slums and this is the best they have seen in their life. They worship these ""Monkey's of Mumbai"" the Midget, The Ugly and The Apeman, since they are promoted by the ""Media Maggots of Mumbai"" who give glorious reviews for the price of banana thrown at them time to time. The comedy was generally demeaning, cheap and vulgar. But the audience had to put up with this, since there was no alternative, and they were not to blame since the scribes were not funny in the first place. The scene is changing with the script-writers and director the caliber of Priyadarshan. This is one funny movie that has opened the flood-gate for movies like ""Mallammal Weekly"" and others.",4
Hera Pheri ,"It is a light-heart old Indian comic , suitable only for the audience from Indian Sub-continent. My dear Non-Hindi speaking friends , its a good movie only if you understand Hindi . Does not make any sense for you to watch the movie dubbed in any other language ( as the comedy and timing goes well with the native language) because it is in TOP 250 list and then write a review that would be titled as ""Spoiled My day "" . No offense to anyone , everyone has their freedom to express their views like I did :)I have seen many non-Indian friends complaining about this , thus writing this review .",5
Hera Pheri ,this movie is awesome wicked and so funny. i love this movie man it awesome. the funniest actors are akshay Kumar and parish rawal. suniel she tty isn't that great.its about these three poor guys who have no money but when a kidnapper calls a wrong number that is written in the phone book and says they have their granddaughter and must give them 10 million dollars so they contact the real man and ask them for 20 million cause so they can have ten by them selfs then the trouble starts not everything goes to plan.guys if you haven't seen it better see it. so guys listen carefully get of your butt and go to your Indian movie store and buy it not rent cause you would want to see this over and over again .,5
Hera Pheri ,His Excellency Mr. Paresh Rawal did Excellent. Excellent.Excellent.His Excellency Mr. Akshay Kumar did Excellent.His Excellency Mr. Sunil Shetty did Excellent.There is something about these three....These three can get together and make very good comedy movie of any form.Thanks and Regards.,5
Hera Pheri ,"There apparently is something I'm missing big time with this film. The effusive praise by many reviewers on this board calling it the best or funniest movie ever is completely lost on me. At present, I've seen an even dozen pictures from India, and they run the gamut from excellent (2015's ""Drishyam"") to dumb and dumber (""Andaz, Apna, Apna""). By further comparison, 2009's ""3 Idiots"" was immensely more satisfying to watch than the three idiots in this picture. To be quite honest, the principal reason I'm drawn to Hindi titles is their placement on IMDb's 'Top 250' film lists, with a personal goal of watching and reviewing all the ones I can. This one, I have to tell you, was a chore to get through. Since we're talking in three's here, this would have made more sense to be called 'The Three Stooges of India', in which case I would have been better prepared for the pratfalls and nonsense going on. By this time I'm well aware that Hindi films often easily exceed two hours, padded by a handful of musical song and dance numbers. That was the case here as well, but my oh my, the second one in this story had to go at least ten minutes. It was so long that one of the principal characters had four or five wardrobe changes! I haven't given up on Indian movies as a result of this picture, but I have to be honest, this one was hard to take.",2
Hera Pheri ,"I love love love this movie and have watched it several times, and each time I laugh out loudly. Its one of those classic comedies that you can watch over and over and appreciate even more for the lack of truly funny movies in this genre. The comedy is completely slapstick, but Paresh Rawal, Akshay Kumar, and Sunil Shetty make it work so well. This is where Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar's comedy partnership commenced, and they have worked in more successful comedies.The story is about three men who have an opportunity to con someone, and everything ends well. I highly recommend it, but be prepared for slapstick comedy. Om Puri is also added to the mix and is funny as well. Om and Paresh make a good pair too.",5
Hera Pheri ,"All comedy fan knows, no one makes as good comedies as Priyadarshan does. and for me, this is the best comedy he has ever done and also best in Hindi cinemas. There are other old good comedies like goalmaal and angoor but this is better than all of those.. No doubt it took all the comic award in 2000. Any Hindi comedy movie fan must watch this.. Best movie ever. If you like this one then you will also enjoy Hungama by the same director and Awara Pagal Deewana. Paresh Raval is the best Hindi comedian in modern era. Don't miss this movie.10/10.",5
Hera Pheri ,"This is absolutely terrible movie. I am huge admirer of IMDb and use it a lot to research wonderful foreign movies. IMDb allows you to explore the world outside of mass culture and lets you get exposure to true cultural diversity. But, sometime you get surprise like this one. This movie is clearly not almost 9 stars creation. 4 stars it may get if all viewers from this culture give highest ratings in some strange exhibition of solidarity. 1-2 stars it probably will deserve, and only thinking heavily on a side of cultural diversity. Who, in right state of mind give it more than 2 stars, is only question that keeps you watching to the end. My advice is to avoid this movie unless you are doing research on psychology of IMDb users.",1
Hera Pheri ,"I agree with couple of reviewers below about IMDb ratings being way off. This movie is over-rated by any which measure at 8/10, I was very generous to give it a 4, probably because of the cast. It is without a doubt the weakest comedy by Priyadarshan. I have seen desi movies grossly overrated or underrated on IMDb and have basically given up relying on IMDb for Bollywood movie reviews all together. If this is the kind of comedy people enjoy and support and reflect the type of movies that are to come out of Bollywood then that explains why we still have the same true and tried formulas coming out over and over 90% of the time. There are better desi movies coming out these days than 10 years ago but this is not one of them.",2
Hera Pheri ,"I saw this recently and was wondering after an hour when it's going to get as funny as everyone says it is...sure there were a couple chuckles here and there, and the plot actually starts right at about the intermission, but the acting was overall ridiculous and the humor was idiotic rather than entertaining. I couldn't help but compare this to another Hindi movie that actually is funny and had me rolling with laughter---Masti! So,if you want a really funny, entertaining Hindi movie with a good plot as well, I recommend Masti rather than this dud of a movie. My rating: 3/10 (there were only a few chuckles here and there)",2
Hera Pheri ,"I don't know where to begin. This film is awful. There is no excuse for producing such an atrocious film. Some films are so bad, they are good. This is not one of them. The acting is below the standard I would expect of a 2nd grade play. The directing is worse than I would expect from a smart phone. The editing may have been put together by throwing the film reels in a blender.The comedy is so poorly executed, with second long delays in actors reactions in slapstick, I am shocked that the hundreds of people who worked on this film were happy to have their name connected with this film. Did nobody provide oversight? My dislike of this film is not because I do not speak Hindi. I have enjoyed many Indian films. This is not one of them.",1
Hera Pheri ,"This movie is one of the best comedy movie ever. Whenever i watch this movie i laugh a lot. Fabulous acting by everyone. This has brilliant comedy and brilliant plot. This movie is not a one time watch you can watch it a lot of times and i promise that this movie will make you laugh a lot. Plot- Three men who live in same house make a plan to earn money by cheating Devi Prasad.Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar did a very very very good job and Paresh Rawal character is unforgettable. The songs are good especially 'Dene wala jab bhi deta, deta chhappad phad ke'. This is a movie that you must watch before you die. I give this movie 10 out of 10.",5
Hera Pheri ,"Now, I've seen plenty of stupid movies but what makes this stand out is the fact that I was on board for the first hour of it. By no means was it anything spectacular up til then but it was alright, especially for a Bollywood movie. But after one hour the movie went full mentally challenged person. They introduced a whole new plot line that had absolutely nothing to do with the first half and by the end it had completely spiraled out of control. All of a sudden this comedy drama of four broke people struggling for money turned into a hostage situation with terrorists, cops and sword-wielding uncles. Oh, and our main characters turned into some weird musketeer trio. This movie was stupid because it threw away everything it had set up in the beginning for some deluded, over complicated story. Which, by the way, only got worse the more you watched it. Highly disappointing since it showed such promise, to not be another over the top, stupid Bollywood movie. 1 out of 10 stars.",1
Hera Pheri ,"when i first saw the rating here 8.6 with over 100 votes i thought: wow, i must watch this movie. but only then i read the storyline. sorry guys, but this movie is an almost remake (as far as the storyline goes) of a big malayalam hit of the 80s, ""ramji rao speaking"" (ramji rao is the villain here), directed by the director duo siddique lal. priyadarshan was such a great director in malayalam. he started with slapstick-movies, then very good comedy movies (chithram, kilukkam) and then even really good serious movies (almost all with actor mohanlal). but then, one day he decided to remake malayalam hits (and not even his own ones, but that too) in Hindi. ""Yeh Teraa Ghar Yeh Meraa Ghar"" for example is a remake of the malayalam movie ""sanmanasullavarku samadhanam"". even the story of his latest malayalam movie ""vettom"" is bit copied from the English movie ""french kiss"" with meg ryan and kevin kline.",0
Hera Pheri ,"Priyadarshan is a the only prominent director from Kerala, in Bollywood!! As he did so many colourful movies in Malayalam, he remade so many Malayalam films in Hindi, and also in Tamil.... He usually remake the films which are got so many surprises and having no supernatural characters.... and of course which are box office hits...!!!! He remakes films of himself, which are also written by him in most turns, and of other film makers... Siddhik and Lal are a famous film making pair in Malayalam film industry. This film is a pure remake of the Malayalam Mega Hit ""Ramji Rao Speaking"". In the original film there is a theater manager and director Mannar Mathai(Innocent) who runs the ""Urvashi Theaters""!!! Gopalakrishnan(Mukesh) is a tenant of Mathai, since the theater is not going appropriately. Balakrishnan(Sai Kumar) came to the city to claim for a job in the company where his late father worked. A girl, Rani(Rekha) also claims for this job, whose late father was also a worker of that company. The manager of the company(Shankaradi) tries to make Balakrishanan to fall in love with the Rani to solve the dispute b/w them. Gopalakrishnan and Balakrishnan were always in making trying to make problems to each other. Gopalakrishnan was mocking in front of his mother(Sukumari)as a millionaire. All the three had so many problems, the only solution is MONEY!!!! Once a phone-call came to Urvashi Theaters from a kidnapper who introduces himself in the phone as ""Ramji Rao Speaking!""..... The kidnapper Ramji Rao(Vijayarakhavan)misunderstands the phone number of Urumees Thmapan(Devan) with that of Urvashi Theaters, from the telephone directory.... Exactly Rao kidnapped the only daughter of Thampan, Nisha. Balakrishnan and companions plays a game in b/w Thampan and Rao.... And that makes more interesting incidences... And construct a good comedy at last !!!!!In the original film Mamukoya plays the role of Hamsakoya, a friend of Balakrishnan.Harishree Ashokan, Alappey Ashraf, Kunchan and NF Varghese also did some small but remarkable roles. Priyadarshan could do the Siddique-Lal Magic's repetition in the Bollywood, up to a limit !!!This movie is a good remake of the original....",5
Hera Pheri ,"The movie is perhaps the best comic flick I have ever watched. It has all the elements and ingredients of a super comedy. From tickling dialogues to impeccable acting from everyone and especially Paresh Rawal, makes this movie a treat to watch. I have watched it numerous times and never get bored of it. Although I am not that kind of a movie maniac but this movie is a real laughter dose. The greatest factor behind the exceptional success of the movie is that there are no attempts of making the audience laugh by overacting by characters or by idiotic script but the situations and circumstances in the script force you to enjoy every bit of the movie.I give this a ten plus rating for all the good reasons and not because of favoritism bias. A must see for every comedy lover.",5
Hera Pheri ,"'Hera Pheri' is my favourite Priyadarshan film and in my opinion, his last good film. He has somewhat specialized himself in comedy since but nothing (perhaps with the exception of 'Hungama' and 'Yeh Tera Ghar Yeh Mera Ghar') comes even remotely close as they are pretty much equivalent to garbage. Coming back to the film at hand 'Hera Pheri' is an almost classic and has good repeat value.The jokes work well because they are about everyday issues and are cleverly written. The characters are relatable as ordinary people trying to meet their daily ends. This is also why the first half of the story works beautifully but it is the second half that goes slightly haywire as it treads the formulaic part (the kidnapping plot which has been used in numerous other comedies such as 'Andaz Apna Apna' and 'Waqt Hamara Hai'). That is not to say that it was devoid of entertainment. Quite the contrary as entertainment is plentiful in 'Hera Pheri'.The cast deserves full marks. It is their playing off each other that worked brilliantly. This was during the time when Paresh Rawal was hilarious and his comedic flair was refreshing and amusing (unlike the staleness and repetition that he approaches in current movies). This was also among the few films when Sunil Shetty actually did act. Tabu is excellent in both the comedic and intense scenes. She's a delight to watch as is Asrani who is awesome. But, 'Hera Pheri' is Akshay Kumar's film. The actor displays his flair for comedy to the fullest and it makes one wish had only more directors cast him in such good comedies that would let him shine as an actor. For Kumar, this was the year when his acting (not stardom) peaked as 'Hera Pheri' was preceded by 'Sangharsh', where he breathed fire into his role, and followed by 'Dhadkan', where he does a splendid job.The songs aren't much of note. The first song is downright boring. I liked the song visualized on Tabu, Sunil Shetty and Asrani. It's one of the funniest songs. The item number does not contribute to the film but Namrata Shirodkar sizzles. The rest of the songs fit well with the story even though some of them are too long.'Hera Pheri' has been recognized as one of the best comedies of recent time. Although I don't want to use the word best here, it is a highly enjoyable film that I have already watched a couple of times.",0

Total Dhamaal,Madhuri full of overacting....Just a good social message...,2
Total Dhamaal,"TOTAL DHAMAAL1: A very over hipped up film for the masses which contains a lot of sleazy and predictable comedy.Now if this film would have released in say the beginning of 2018 then maybe it could have won the masses hearts but with the success of badhai ho etc the masses have also decided to love good stories and not the cast so now let us go to our section which isThings that may work1. CAST: The biggest thing that can bring the audience to the theater is the cast which mostly all these big budget films try to do. The mantra for success for a hit in India is the *CAST BRINGS THE MASS*2.CHILDREN: The reason why many people will go although even not liking the content is the children. Kids need such films THEY CAN'T BE BORN AS CRITICS RIGHT? If you are dying to get the sweet kiss from your kid then don't read this review and just go to the hall and enjoy3. DHAMAAL: the first film of the franchise has a fair amount of cult. Hence the people may go for it seeking a similar filmTHING WHICH MAY NOT WORK1. WORD OF MOUTH: Mark my word this film is not going to get a good word of mouth as till the end of the film you feel the sense of sleaze and would not try to experience this again.2 NO CREATIVITY: I hate films which are made with the same story but with a bigger budget (e.g baaghi 2)coz the story of this film is just the same as Jamaal
DHAMAAL TOTAL DHAMAAL
The secret was of ten crores The secret is of 50 crores
The classic helicopter scene The same helicopter scene
The same ending
NOW let's MOVE ON TO THE REVIEWActing: To be frank none of the actors put an impact on me at the end.No one could be remembered like KAMLI (Sanju). Even great actors like Sanjay Mishra and Ajay Devgn didn't put an impact on me Sanjay Mishra kept on calling Ajay Devgn bro and after a point it became irritating.SONGS: The songs of the film is PURE S***. I Hated them the lyrics are less the background score is louder and irritating.WRITING: THERE IS NOT MUCH WRITING DONE FOR THIS FILM EXCEPT FOR BRO BRO BRO BRO BRO AND SOME STUPID SLAPSTICK PUNCHESSCREENPLAY: SCREENPLAY IS LAZILY PENNED. EACH CHARACTER DOES NOT KNOW WHY THEY ARE DOING AND WHAT.VFX: The only thing to go for this film is the vfx IF YOU LIKE TO WATCH SUCH STUFF THEN GO FOR ITANIMALS: The adventure part of the film with animals is also a thing to go for but if i just wanted to see animals on screen then i would rather go to a zoo.FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY WITH KIDS THEN DO GO FOR THIS FILM. BUT IF YOUR FAMILY IS INTERESTED IN GOOD CINEMA THEN DON'T JAM YOUR HEADS AND EMPTY YOUR POCKETS ON THIS FILM. I would rather watch GULLY BOY OR URI THIS WEEK IF I WOULD BE GOING ALONE.RATING

Kachindo,"After seeing The Scent of Green Papaya, I was not expecting much, just a vehicle for Catherine Deneuve.  And while it most definitely is that, it is also so much more.The stunning cinematography, the elegant score, and the epic love story set against the turbulent colonial times.  I was quite taken with the myriad plot twists.  Too bad our high schooler has a 3minute attention span.This is a very real depiction of colonialism.  One reviewer noted the maternalism of Deneuve's character while pointing out the brutality of the slave sellers.  People expecting a total condemnation of colonialism or a total condemnation of communism just don't see the gray between the black and white.  Unfortunately, only Europeans could have made this movie.  There is no didactic viewpoint, which is why some Americans don't react well to it.    While the ending is a bit flat, it still doesn't detract from the fact that this was a great movie.One of the little pleasures of this movie is listening to the Vietnamese housemaid's pidgin French and reading the subtitled translation.   While movies like The Scent of Green Papaya are wonderful and deserve all the accolades they are accorded, this movie is very underrated.  Green Papaya is a nice cultural experience but it can't come close to Indochine for grit and history.  3 1/2 stars out of 4.",0
Kachindo,"I thought it was good, if over-long. I've been reading the comments and people saying things about Indochine's realism. From what I can understand from my family (who are all half-French, half-Vietnamese, and who left Vietnam pretty much at the time the film wraps up), the sense you get of Eliane ""being in charge"" of the Vietnamese, and the failure to look at things from the viewpoint of the Vietnamese themselves, but only from the French perspective, is pretty accurate. Society was essentially segregated in Saigon / Indochina. One member of my family told me a story about how they left the French ""compound"" in Saigon one day with their mother and - for the first time - saw the real Vietnamese people, in tattered clothes... Cue ""why are they in rags, mummy?"" ""because that's the way most people live."" So, as I see it at least, I wouldn't criticise this film for the sense you get of the French being oblivious to the reality of their existence in Indochina. That's the way it was. That's the way most colonies were, in fact (think Shanghai). And I think that's the masterstroke of this film: that people lived their lives without ever thinking about the broader impact of what was going on, until everything just fell to pieces around their ears.",4
Kachindo,"There is some difference of opinion about whether this is a good film or not. Some have called it a ""soap opera"" beautifully filmed. (Both Leonard Maltin in his Movie and Video Guide and the good people at Video Hound used that designation.) But I don't think that is correct at all. Beautifully filmed yes, stunning at times like something from David Lean; and in fact this film has more in common with the Hollywood panoramic epic than it does with the tradition of the French cinema. But it is certainly not a soap opera. In a soap opera the important element is a narrow focus on things material, social, and sexual played out in a banal, clich-ridden and bourgeois manner. In Indochine the focus is on political change and why it came about.The story begins in Vietnam in 1930 and concludes on the eve of the communist revolution in 1954--presaging the tragic American involvement a decade later. Catherine Deneuve plays Eliane Devries, the strong-willed owner of a rubber plantation in Vietnam, then part of the French colonial empire. Having no children of her own (or a husband) she raises the Vietnamese girl Camille (Linh Dan Pham) as her own. She conducts secret affairs (and even visits opium dens) while maintaining the appearance of respectability. We are shown the decadence of the French living in Vietnam and the exploitive evils of colonialism, hardy the stuff of soap opera. We are made aware of the social unrest stirring amongst the population and even shown what amounts to a slave auction conducted by the colonial powers with the aid of the French military, in particular, the French navy.Enter Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez), a handsome French naval officer who, despite the difference in their ages, initiates an affair with Eliane. She is at first put off, then reluctant, and then madly in love. Perhaps this familiar progression is what some think of as soap opera material; and perhaps it is, although their affair is only a small part of the film, and at any rate, such behavior is entirely consistent with Eliane's character and that of Jean-Baptiste, and is necessary for the plot developments to come.Deneuve was nominated for Best Actress by the Academy but didn't win (Emma Thompson won for Howard's End), but the film itself won as Best Foreign Film. In truth Deneuve's performance is a little uneven. Regardless, this is one of the most important roles in the career of an actress who was as beautiful in 1991 when this film was made as she had been in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) at the beginning of her career. Indeed, I would say even more beautiful. My favorite Deneuve film, by the way, is Mississippi Mermaid (1969) with Jean-Paul Belmondo directed by Francois Truffaut.Also uneven is the direction by Regis Wargnier. The scenes set in Saigon involving the French and the Mandarins at their pleasures amid their wealth as they maintain their privilege are done with strikingly beautiful interiors splashed with the kind of color seen in, for example, the films of Chinese director Zhang Yimou. The scenes amount to indictments of the French and demonstrate why the communists eventually came to power. Note that the privileged are always decked out in the most amazing displays of color while the workers and the peasants are brown and dirty.The panoramic cinematography of the Vietnamese country is also strikingly beautiful. We are shown the sheer cliffs falling into tranquil waters dotted with junks, the rock outcrops nestled in verdant growth, the angry skies, and the deluge of the monsoon. But the trek of Camille across the land to find her beloved is not realistically done. Her quick incorporation in a peasant family is also not convincing. And the following scene in which she and Jean-Baptiste escape from the slave market defies probability. However what becomes of her and him is brutally realistic and consistent with what we know about those times, although I would like to have seen them being fed when they are rescued and some indication of how they spent their time in that Shangri-la-like hidden valley.Despite the flaws and inconsistencies, this is a fine cinematic experience, enthralling, disturbing and visually beautiful. See this as a prelude to all other films about Vietnam and the Vietnam War. What will become clear is how foolish was our involvement and how doomed to failure it had to be.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",5
Kachindo,"OK let's get it out of the way up front, Eliane IS France, Camille IS Vietnam the story is their story. Of course it is told from the French viewpoint, France is telling the story about her child growing up. It is a sad story, the French lost. It was not a happy story for the Vietnamese they had to fight for 2 more years to be reunited and struggle for 15 more to start to come out of the whole process. That said this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, period.The intricate ballet of personal dealings and politics is carried out so well that one can easily get lost in the levels, just as one can get lost in the intricate dance that is life in Asia. What you see is what you see, it may be more or less depending.I do not believe that the movie defends France not does it condemn her. That part of the story is wisely left alone, what remains is a human drama of the folly of resisting the inevitability of change. As the film unfolds the sheer weight of history comes down on all involved.It is that weight that brings the tears. From the time that Jean-Baptiste is brought to Saigon to the closing credits, there is no escape for anyone. The old order is out the new is awaiting its time of entry upon the stage. It is a time for tears, a time to mourn and ultimately a time to heal.Americans in particular have a funny sense of history. We forget that others have been down the same roads before us. France's relationship with vietnam was most likely more of a force in the history of its people than ours with all of our napalm will ever be, because the French left a legacy of life that could be seen even in the senslessness of the American presence.This movie captures that relationship and transcends it. Masterpiece is the lest one can say about such a work.",0
Kachindo,"This is a wonderful very tragic movie about love triangle set against French fall down in Vietnam. I was actually quite surprised at one of the comments, which roughly said that the Vietnamese girl falls in love with French officer for no reason at all. Does not everybody know that love always happens for no reason at all? That is why many famous love stories are tragic, people tend to fall in love with completely wrong people, from different perspectives.I did not seem wrong to me that Elaine was ""mothering"" her Vietnamese workers. Remember ""Gone with the wind""? How Scarlett's mother was treating her slaves, tending to them when they were sick? I believe that many people felt that way towards their slaves/servants/workers. Elaine grew up in Vietnam, she thought about it as her home and Vietnamese as her people, though in a bit simplistic way. What I am trying to say, is that her relationship with Vietnamese in the movie does not look untrue. Perhaps to some people it just looks politically incorrect these days, when most people think that colonization was all that bad. It is too complicated an issue and the movie was not about it. On the contrary, the movie wins while portraying both caring and cruel French people in Indochina, not painting only with black and white colors, rather raising questions, than giving simplistic answers. It is rare in movies these days. This movie is done with impeccable European charm and gets 10/10 from me.I am ready to defend my viewpoint at the Message Boards any time.",5
Kachindo,"If we think about movies that deal with the recent past of Vietnam, then everybody immediately thinks of war movies like for instance, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter... But why is that? I know how important this war was for the Americans as well as for the Vietnamese, but this is an old country with an ancient culture that has a lot more to offer than the battles, bombs and booby traps in the jungle, the rice fields or the cities. ""Indochine"" is a movie that tries to show us another part of the country's history. It deals with the latest years of French colonial times in Vietnam or Indochine as they called it back then.The story starts in the 1930's at one of the largest rubber-tree plantations in Indochine (Vietnam). This plantation is owned by the French colonist Eliane, a proud woman who lives with her father and her native adoptive daughter Camille. She doesn't have a husband or a man in her life (apart from her father), but gets to know the young officer Jean-Baptiste when both want to buy the same painting at an auction. They have a short affair, but than she refuses to see him again. In the meantime it's Camille who has fallen in love with Jean-Baptiste and Eliane knows it. She makes sure he's send to one of the most desolate outposts on some remote island, making sure that the two will never see each other again. Camille has no choice, but to marry the man she was promised to, but in the meantime she starts a search to find the man she really loves.This could have been a romantic movie in a different setting than we are used to, but nevertheless one like we have seen many more before. And in a way it is, but the movie has a lot more to offer as well. It shows the atrocities committed by the French, the great poverty of the indigenous people, the rise of Communism and the futile attempts to stop them (before the French got involved in the war that would later be continued by the Americans). This movie is a lesson in history and geography wrapped in a paper of romance and marvelous landscapes. It was beautiful and dramatic at the same time. I was touched and amazed by it and really liked it a lot. That's why I give this movie at least an 8/10.",4
Kachindo,I first saw this movie as a college project and was just blown away. It has a really decent plot that allows one to enjoy the movie while giving a history lesson and some of the reasons for the war between the French and Vietnamese people. A good see for those who want to see a different kind of movie and a MUST see for anyone interested in the history of the French involvement in Vietnam and the reasons for the intense dislike of the French by the common man in Vietnam. The scenery is outstanding. You will need to be ready to pay attention because the movie is in French and has English Subtitles. I think that this adds to the allure of the movie and did not take away from my enjoyment.,5
Kachindo,"Indochine is a wonderful, poignant film set in the 30's during the French Vietnam conflicts. Catherine Deneuve is the terribly engrossing heroine,Elaine Devries, who uses her wealthy status as a rubber plantation owner to cover up her affairs. However, things get complicated when her adopted daughter falls in love with her much younger lover. This movie shows a wonderful unbiased perspective about Vietnam, and the acting is superb, with Vincent Perez and Dominique Blanc. This is a intricate and complex movie that will leave you thinking long after the movie is finished.",0
Kachindo,"I've seen at least 10-20 post-Vietnam movies, nearly all concentrating on the war or the aftermath of a war in a country that most Americans know absolutely nothing about (including me).What a relief it was to learn something about the years of mistreatment Indo-Chine (or Vietnam) suffered at the hands of the French colonists who seem to have the 'reverse-Midas-touch' when it comes to their land possessions. Then again, I suppose this is the way of all colonists who invariably mistreat their 'possessions'..The acting was terrific by all involved.  Learning the pre-war background behind the extreme North/South polarizations and seeing all the strife that's touched Vietnam was the best lesson I've yet gleaned from any Vietnam movie.I think a cure has finally been developed for Oliver Stone.As high a rating as possible.",0
Kachindo,"A beautiful film about the latter years of the French colonial era in Vietnam. I notice some comments that seem confused about Deneuve's characters attitude toward the Vietnamese on her rubber plantation. They find her ""maternalism"" offensive and therefore? what, they don't like the film? What do they expect from a colonialist? Compare this to Mel Gibson's character in The Patriot, a slave owner who has released all his slaves (1700s) and re-hired them. Is this more believable? More comfortable?The French exploited the natural resources and the population of Vietnam; that's what colonialism was all about, and I don't see that this film is even faintly supportive of colonialism. On the contrary, Indochine offers some clarity about what the Vietnamese were rebelling against, and background for the conflict that would later pull in the US.And a gorgeous, gorgeous movie.",4
Kachindo,"Not many foreign films have caught my eye. A lot of them seem surreal and have hidden messages that you have to try hard to convey. Indochine is different. It is intense and gripping and all the while you never lose sense of the message. The love story intertwined makes it remarkably attractive to females, the adventure makes it great for males, and the epic history of Vietnam makes it a masterpiece to critics and professionals. I thoroughly found this film to excel and it does live up to its praise.",5
Kachindo,"Just watched this movie on VHS on a TV. It was not like seeing it for the first time on a large screen in a theater. Watched it in French without subtitle, because I am bilingual. Probably that is helps to like the movie. The plot is a bit stretched, but the historical perspective is very good. It serves as a good educational tool, to understand the reasons behind the defeat of France and after that the USA. The scenery is just incredible. Deneuve is a great actress and the other actors too including even minor supporting actors. It is not an action pack movie with a rapid pace; but the plot is so interesting, it is never boring.",5
Kachindo,"I got a better understanding of why the Vietnamese people turned to Communism. Hell, With folks like the French as the murdering, raping, occupying force,  who wouldn't rebel. But the film isn't just a social commentary, It's a beautiful albeit tragic love story. I didn't particularly like the ending. I was looking for that reconciliation but then I realized it doesn't always happen that way. See it. The acting is superb, the storyline and cinematography is great and, even if you don't want to, you'll learn something about history.",5
Kachindo,"I was never aware of this film, perhaps because I was not of the appropriate age to appreciate, but I must say, about thirteen years after its theatrical release, I was quite pleased with it on every level. Not only were the locations appropriately beautiful, and the cinematography mature and relaxed, but the acting, casting, plot development, and dialogue were in beautiful harmony. The film was a fantastic lesson in history to which Vietnam and the rest of us are owed. To satisfy length requirements for my comments, I will add, that this crew did not shy away from showing characters who experience anger, insult, jealousy, pain and all the rest with true precision. It is nice to see fine acting and depth with appropriate casting. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see color and who can read subtitles. I would also recommend that this film be viewed in two or three sittings. I did this because of disruptions, but actually, this respite added to the inherent suspense of each characters' fate and made the film easier to digest on a whole. Nonetheless, you will find, that the film flows and throws in excitement just where it is needed.",4
Kachindo,"(SPOILERS) Regis Wargnier's Indochine is superb. The premise is simple enough: Eliane, a wealthy French landowner has an adopted Vietnamese daughter during French Indochina. Her life revolves her adored daughter and her extensive rubber plantation. Ultimately, they separate.But what's complex is the relationship between Eliane and the people she controls (her workers, her child) which underlines the fraught relationship an empire has with her colonies. Eliane symbolizes the French empire while Camille symbolizes Indochina (which ultimately broke free from France). Eliane is both paternalistic and maternal, both cruel and kind at the same time, a privilege the empires have on their colonies. She protects a little boy, she whips a male worker for an offense - all this regarded by her as something maternal: a parent's love towards her child. She adores her plantation and runs it effectively and proudly.At the same time, she passionately loves Camille who is very close to her; too passionately perhaps to the point of being controlling like she is with everything in her life. She tells Camille that there is no difference between races, that she (Eliane) is in fact Asian (as she was born in Indochina and has lived all her life there). But this is far from the truth. There is in fact an unequal relationship, of which Eliane enjoys the better end of the stick. The passionate tango which the mother and daughter performs at their Christmas party shows this. At first glance the dance is innocent. However, we see that Eliane whispers to Camille that she wants to be alone with her in a mountain chalet ""like in the fairy tales"". This parodies a heterosexual courting relationship and illustrates Eliane's masculinity (equated with the need to dominate) - not surprising as Eliane is thrust into the role of command usually linked to men and therefore enjoy the privileges accorded to men. This also illustrates the fact that despite their bond, there's no doubt that Eliane is linked to European privilege and that Camille is pampered, adored and doesn't stray far - France's exotic little pet.But ultimately Indochina decides she no longer wants to be a pet. The turning point of the mother-daughter relationship starts when young and handsome Jean-Baptiste, a naval officer, enters the picture. Eliane's and Camille's tranquil life together is rocked. Eliane's usual cold and distant (and not to mention, secretive) approach to relationships is shattered when she actually falls for hims; the situation is made impossible when her daughter Camille also falls for Jean-Baptiste after being ""saved"" by him at a shooting. Jealous and hurt, Eliane orders him to be posted to the remote Con Dao islands. However, she underestimates Camille's will. Love-struck, Camille sets out cross country to go to Jean-Baptiste. Eliane and Camille's relationship as they knew it is never the same again.Indochine is a superb picture illustrating a mother's love and control towards her child, and how the dependent child must ultimately separate, a metaphor of the fact that all empires end.Make no mistake that this is France's story of the empire she lost; in fact from the very start of the movie, we hear Eliane narrating the story. Even when Camille was running away through the countryside, it is through Eliane's lens that we see the voyage. We don't see her Communist training. The details are unknown to Eliane. Eliane is simply imposing her emotions and narration on what happened, just like an empire imposes and creates the stories of her colonies.The story is told with a charismatic soundtrack and cinematography. The shots of the Vietnamese countryside and the famous Ha Long Bay simply take your breath away, alongside with the shots of the rubber plantation misty in the morning. Eliane's wardrobe is also a feast for the eyes.Excellent performances from Catherine Deneuve and Linh Dam Pham, whose portrayal of their characters' outward restraint and control also successfully show us their turmoil and pain. Deneuve was truly deserving of her Oscar nomination and Cesar win (alongside with the Golden Globe). Indochine has become one of her celebrated latter-day works, and rightly so.However, one point off for the movie taking too long to unfurl; there is a sub-plot involving Yvette, the wife of Eliane's French coolie, that I did not care to know about. But over-all, a superb film, greatly nostalgic, which at the end may leave you with a heavy, melancholic feeling.",5
Kachindo,"This film was made with such breathtaking care that I don't expect to see another film that will move me with such intensity. The story line is told with painstaking detail in Vietnam against the back drop of war, and that's what makes this movie so poignant, you understand the characters, through the little details, so well, that you cannot help but feel that what you perceive is what these characters are feeling. I literally cried throughout 15 of the films' 90 minute runtime, not just a tear in the eye ""oh that's too bad,"" but sobbing ""OH MY GOD WHY, WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN?!"" Catherine's character and the Vietnam girl play it to perfection.I remember a comment kept running through my head, ""this is not fair, it's not fair it had to happen to them, it's not their fault, dammit it's not their fault."" This film is a representation of how good dramatic anime can be, if used correctly. There are no kung fu fights, or mysterious dragons, only reality. Such horrible wonderful reality that one will find that they cannot think about war in the same way as they did before. I know that this was the greatest war movie I have ever seen. It also might just be the greatest film ever. See it, don't walk, run, you must see this",5
Kachindo,"I first saw this movie in a french class at univ. I don't think it is a film talking about communists or communism,it is more like a brief history of Vietnam under control by France. Every country has its own style and way of developing,so telling a love story can't part from the condition or the atmosphere.It is not a happy-ending love story,I don't know whether ""tragedy"" is a proper word, but it fills with joys and sorrows.I like something with deep meanings and deep feelings or emotions.Indochine is right for me.I am not sure where the film was shot,the scenery is nice and characteristic. The roles are vivid and rich,esp Eliane played by Catherine Deneuve. Although i had to read the English subtitles while listening to french, the film still grabbed my attention tightly.",4
Kachindo,"If you are looking for a complete and touching story of Vietnam under colonialism, this would be one of the better films to watch. I found the setting and the portrayal of Viet Nam to be very thought-provoking and historical, and I felt that the roles that the characters played were compelling. The human story is very complete in its' portrayal, at the end leaving you fulfilled with the time that you have invested. It is quite thought-provoking and emotional, from start to finish.The evolution of the film and the growth of its' characters left nothing to be desired, and it was definitely well-executed with a historical, haunting background.",4
Kachindo,"I saw this movie first when I was only 14 and I fell in love with it. It has a wonderful storyline and it keeps you involved from beginning to end. The cast is magnificent, each playing their character with amazing believability and accuracy. Besides being educational (for those of us who are or were unversed in the history of the rubber industry in Indo-China, as I was), it also has stunning cinematography. There are plenty of pan and aerial shots to keep you amazed throughout the movie. The only disadvantage for some viewers may be that it is French with English subtitles. But if you decide to rent this movie, I highly doubt you will be disappointed, it's a definite 10 out of 10.",5
Kachindo,One of the ten greatest films of the last 25 years. I could watch it again and again for the nuances and the scenery and the recreation of an age and a place. Right up there with the best! DeNeuve deserved the Oscar she didn't get.,0
Kachindo,"Some of the INDOCHINE comments already posted are so powerful that I was hesitant to offer my own. I am not an authority on the art of cinema, preferring to experience films and then see what I think/feel about them. INDOCHINE is a profoundly beautiful and moving film. I watch it now and then to recalibrate my moral compass.Background: I believe that colonialism's fate was sealed with the invention of movable type. Granted, it seemed unstoppable for a few centuries, but all forms of Manifest Destiny, et. al, like all dogs, eventually have their day. So will those that are currently wallowing in ""puerile, self-congratulatory nationalism,"" to borrow a phrase from Carl Sagan. Philosophically speaking, colonialism, like slavery, is indefensible. What's to like, unless you're the one doing it? True, there are films that celebrate the triumph of colonial powers over lesser beings. Here are three: THE FOUR FEATHERS, THE SAND PEBBLES, sort of, and GUNGA DIN, also sort of. GUNGA DIN, however, imputes more intelligence to the erudite Thugee leader, GURU, than the three loutish British noncoms who fight him to preserve the RAJ. The noble, water-carrying Gunga Din, a sort of human reincarnation of Rin-Tin-Tin, saves the day and gives his life for his beloved leaders. More than often, such films serve patriotic purposes. Whatever works, eh?INDOCHINE is a fine example of cinematic art with a strong message about social justice and the rights, under Natural Law, of all peoples. It is strikingly beautiful. But under all this beauty lay injustice, cruel exploitation and addiction to drugs and sexual appetites. One sees the rot and decay of the French and Mandarin ruling classes. Compared to them, the Communists didn't look half bad. For more on that subject, look up THE NEW CLASS, by Milovan Djilas, in Wikopedia if you don't want to read it.Just as France held fast to her colonies in Indochina like a parasite, colonist/rubber plantation owner Emile fastened on to his daughter, Elaine. In turn, she clung to her beautiful adopted daughter, Camille. The most striking metaphor was the Tango scene, in which mother and daughter danced a grotesque parody of romance. The young naval officer, Jean Baptiste, saw this very clearly. Confronting Elaine with this awful truth got him banished, his naval career in tatters (actually, it's not quite that simple). It also put in motion a tragic set of events that convulsed the lives of all concerned. The love between Camille and Jean Baptiste survived, living on through their infant son, Etienne, who was adopted and raised by Elaine. Every time I watch this remarkable film I feel emotionally drained. Time to watch something light and funny, eh?",0
Kachindo,"""Indochine"" is epic film-making of a kind rarely practiced any longer. To me, it brought to mind ""Gone With The Wind"" and the films of David Lean, but I enjoyed it far more. The film's cinematography, production design, and costumes are stunning - never forced or pretty for their own sake, but appropriate and executed with consummate craftsmanship. ""Indochine"" tells of the demise of French colonialism in what became Vietnam in an even-handed manner, never placing all virtue on any one side, but narrating its story through characters who are dimensional, flawed, and recognizably human; in only one case is there a character who is completely unsympathetic, and that is a bit part. It is never easy to create characters who exhibit reprehensible qualities but still keep the audience interested in and sympathetic to them; ""Indochine"" accomplishes this adroitly. The issues of France's colonial interest in Indochina come across in a natural, nuanced way through the actions of the large and varied cast, without it ever seeming like we're getting a history lesson. Catherine Deneuve's reputation as a somewhat chilly actress is used to good effect here, which is not to suggest that her performance is at all one-note. Of interest is the depiction of the relationship between the French, and the natives who are essentially subjugated and exploited; however, there is real affection, at times, between members of the two groups, until the forces of history take over. The story of ""Indochine"" has many parallels throughout history - the story of a European (or American) interest moving in on the resources of an undeveloped country and appropriating them for its own profit and to the detriment of the inhabitants of the region. Somehow it took me fifteen years to get around to seeing this film, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. The film exceeded my expectations, and I recommend it to anyone interested in intelligent, yet still entertaining, film-making.",0
Kachindo,"A brilliant movie. I liked it very very much - great story, well-told, wonderful cast. There is everything in this story - atmosphere,love, pain, forgiveness. And Catherine Deneuve is a terrific choice - she is GREAT.",5
Kachindo,"I can understand Americans' harsh criticism of this film. This movie is far from Hollywood blockbusters that wash their brains. This is a masterpiece. Who called the play of Deneuve uneven? Actually, she lost the Academy Award to Thompson just because they do not like French actresses in the Academy. Let's recall Adjani in Camille Clodelle. Another masterpiece that lost Oscar to Anglo Saxon actress. Deneuve's performance is not only the Award winning performance, it is a cosmic, universal achievement of humanity. And there are no enough expressions and words to describe the magic of this movie. Let's do not get into the details of historical inconsistencies found by some paranoic personalities. Let's watch the movie through the eyes of French and Vietnamese people and not through the judgemental eyes of some always reprimanding complaners.",5
Kachindo,"... and there's a lot of that about because Vietnam WAS Indochina at the time this movie deals with which is primarily the 1930s. Eliane Devries (Catherine Deneuve) has both a daughter and a son yet has never given birth which is maybe a metaphor for France 'adopting' Indochina. Like Heart Of Darkness the film employs a frame-narrator in the shape of Deneuve who begins by telling her story to Camille (Linh Dan Pham) whose parents have just been killed and because they were Eliane's best friends she has adopted Camille - who comes with a dowry of her parent's land which swell the size of Eliane's rubber plantation - and both raises and loves her as her own. Devries is a chic Frenchwoman who, for reasons never satisfactorily explained, has forsaken the chic, culture and civilisation of France for a superficially beautiful yet ultimately harsh land that's not unlike the ante-bellum South without the Mississippi. When a young naval officer, Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez) appears on the scene the inevitable happens and May and December have their mayfly moment. Jean-Baptiste was, of course, the name of the mime artist in Les Enfants du Paradis and is well chosen given that Perez, who has all the charisma of the Black Hole of Calcutta on a bad day, might just as well be miming for all the animation he brings to his lines. Equally inevitably Camille falls in love with him and when Deneuve has him transferred to a remote outpost Camille follows him and contrives to kill one of his colleagues putting them both on the run. All this is played out against the political unrest that is always a by-product of colonialism. In turn Camille has a child by Jean-Baptiste; he is killed, she becomes something of a Vietnamese La Passionara and Deneuve winds up holding the baby and it is he, now a grown man, to whom Deneuve is narrating the story in 1954 as Indochina became Vietnam. Weighing in at two and a half hours it requires stamina but in addition to Deneuve both Jean Yanne and Dominique Blanc are on hand and against all the odds it does keep you watching.",4
Us,"I liked the movie a lot. I thought it was very well shot and very well acted, and I can appreciate Peele's subtle homages to previous horror films throughout. However, the story itself is very weak and a bit of a mess.A big concern for the main characters, as well as for the viewers, is why these doppelgngers (known in the movie as The Tethered) are attacking. So we are lead from almost the beginning, to want those answers, and when they're actually delivered, it's pretty unsatisfying.The logic (or lackthereof) of The Tethered's existence and motivation is very messy and ultimately ruins the final conclusion of the film, because it leaves too many holes in the story that need to be answered.If Peele had removed the explanation element as to the Tethered's existence, functionality etc. it would have made it a better story in my opinion. It becomes then a survival horror film, and leaves more to the viewer's imagination and thoughts as to the how and why, and that could even leave some good opportunities for symbolism etc. which Peele is known for. Not to mention it would have made the final conclusion even more shocking, compelling and thought provoking, and viewers would be talking about it for a long time, in all the best ways. Instead we're left talking about the many plot holes in the explanation.All in all, as a standalone movie, it's really good and I can appreciate it for what it is, despite some of it's plot points I'd like further explanation on.Also, I don't really think it can or should be compared to Get Out in any way because they're two completely different films, in genre and the overall tone. Us is a horror film and Get Out is a social thriller. So it's unfair to pit them against each other, or put them in the same league, even though they share the same director. I feel like people looking to do that are going to end up disappointed with this movie no matter what.",4
Us,"Trailer was better than the movie. To me this movie just never takes off. It's a shame because there is some fantastic imagery and a wonderful theme lying underneath but in the end it can not overcome its plot holes and failed delivery of the message its trying to speak. It truly believes it's deeper than it is, but left me unfulfilled. Kind of lazy/rushed writing in my opinion. Kind of just throws a bunch of mediocre stuff at you without any real substance and expects the audience to give it purpose and deeper meaning in there own heads. Which is fine to do but to me this movie wasn't worthy of that merit of thought. You keep waiting for it to evolve but it just never does. Honestly can't believe critics are putting this on such a pedestal giving it such rave reviews.",3
Us,"I am torn on whether or not I like the story of Us. Part of me really likes the originality of the idea and the subtle social commentary the film delivers; however, I felt that despite Us having an interesting idea, the execution led to a disjointed story that felt a bit scatterbrained. There were definitely parts of the film that were suspenseful and horrifying, but at the same time, other parts felt too over-explained or tropey. This leads to me having many unanswered questions about certain aspects and feeling like other aspects shouldn't have been explained at all to keep the mystery. I think the story is hard to talk about without spoiling it, but overall, I expected more from Jordan Peele's writing but did enjoy some of it.Despite my indecisive feelings of the film's story, many pieces of the film were exceptionally well done. One aspect that stood out in Us was the soundtrack and the usage of music. I think the original soundtrack was memorable and used appropriately to accentuate the feeling of horror at some points in the film. On the flip side, the soundtrack was used to perfectly contrast what was going on onscreen. This led to some great sequences (the Beach Boys scene) that utilized the soundtrack in an interesting way. Another part of the film that I really enjoyed was Lupita Nyong'o and the child actors' performances. Nyong'o in particular is the most terrifying part of the film. She plays both a horrific monster and a badass mother, making it easy to forget that the same actor plays them.As a whole, I think Us is an enjoyable horror film that has some missteps with its story elements and structure. I would recommend this film to horror fans, but don't go into the film expecting anything like Get Out.",4
Us,"I understand what was trying to be achieved but it fell flat.This movie reminded me of movies like the mist or cloverfield. There is this underlying plot of ""sci-fi experiment gone wrong"" that doesn't get explained. However in this film we get a small but lazy explanation. This came in the form of a text card at the beginning of the film that basically reads ""There thousands of tunnels in the world. Who knows what's in them"". This was the movies only explanation and setup for a civilization of 6 million clones of people living in an underground tunnel. When the movie ended and it pieced together to be this it made for an overarching plot that was just stupid.Now these clones did refer to themselves as shadows because they were sometimes forced to mimic the movements of the person they are cloned after. It was weird how selective that was and is very inconsistent in a way that hurt a couple scenes in the movie.The rest of the movie is just those 6 million clones coming out of the tunnel and killing the person they are cloned after. Once they accomplish that they hold hands and form a line stretching across the United States. And no I'm not kidding, this is exactly how the movie ends.The only redeeming qualities was good acting, good music, and decent humor. However, none of that can fix a terrible plot that ended with an nonsensical twist. Like a sour cherry ontop.",2
Us,"I am sure that this review is going to get a ton of down votes and I am pretty sure that all those 10/10 reviews are bot accounts (if you dont believe me check the profiles) so I wont spent much time analyzing the film. Many many plot holes,little substance and ultimately you have a movie with a weak script based on a good idea that takes itself way to seriously without achieving even half of what it promises. Get out worked that well because it didn't take itself that seriously and there was always an underlying tone of dark comedy to it. It gets a 5 because I liked the cinematography and I thought that the performances where actually quite good!",3
Us,"Like other reviewers, first 20-30 minutes was good and then when the doppelgnger started speaking, it went downhill from there. It was slow, longer than it should have been, pretentious, and by the end boring. The dumb screeching from the doppelgngers, the lack of a good script (some parts made absolutely no sense), the attempt to be both funny and scary at the same time... My husband and I almost fell asleep at the end! Is that what a good horror/thriller should do to you? We had such high hopes for this film and both left disappointed. Not sure how people are rating it even close to a 10. I've never left a movie review before so imagine how disappointed I was to leave this. The only good thing is that the movie was free because we had a gift card.",2
Us,Was excited to watch this movie with all the hype surrounding it. The first 20 mins or so was on par with my expectations and then it just fell flat on its face. Not nearly as good as Get Out. Way to many plot holes and un answered questions. Acting was decent and writing was average. Some funny parts and the soundtrack are the only thing that really saves this movie from being a 3 or a 4.,3
Us,"People thinking this will be a straight-forward horror film will be disappointed; Us (2019) is a complex, mind bending experience that tests the limitations of what a horror film can be. What's great about the film is how differently people will interpret what they've witnessed. I left the theater tonight to the sounds of people passionately discussing theories, different explanations and thoughts on it all - and that, to me, is one of the great joys in leaving a great film.",4
Us,"I hate saying this, but this film is the product of when you've got incredible everything and an underdeveloped script. The concepts are great, but lose their value and appreciation because there is so much with so little explanation, leaving me with the impression that they were not completely thought-out.
Acting was incredible, cinematography, lighting, set design, and sound track were wonderful too! It's just that the script and story does not fully deliver. It's so conceptual that it loses horror, yet so rushed in execution that it loses coherence.",3
Us,"Jordan Peele is at it again!Hard to say too much about this one without spoiling, but here goes.
The acting is good, especially considering many of the actors plays two roles. They all do a bang up job in that regard. So no trouble so far.
The movie looks good. I have no complains here either. It's technically very well made. We always see what's going on, no shaky cam or anything like that. Some nice shots too.
The humor works pretty well, the dialogue comes off as natural.
I like the beginning of the movie, the family is pretty likable.
The movie is sort of a mystery, and when the mystery unravels is when we get to some slight problems. The scrips seems to be based on a pretty good idea, that was never thoroughly worked out. It just isn't thought all the way through.
I am left with several questions, and not in a good way.
This is spoiler terriroty, so I won't go into detail, but it didn't sit well with me. Doesn't seem to make sense. The plot has more holes than a swizz cheese. (that almost no critics talk about this is very strange)Now, in the movies defence, the sub-genre it turne out to be is very far from my favorite, so others might like it better. I've seen a lot of horror movies, and this is just not one of the best ones. It is mediocre.
Not a weak movie, but definitely no classic. Will not be watching it again.",3
Us,"All I can say is cringe cringe cringe. The ""demonic voices"" and terrible plot made me laugh (and die a little inside) the entire movie...that's all I have to say. Way over rated film...",2
Us,"All this movie wants you to do is go on the internet afterwards and read the 75 million different theories people have about it.Also to call this a ""horror movie"" is comical. Dumbest movie I've seen in a while.",2
Us,"Where do I start with this review? This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life, and I have watched a lot of movies. I came into this movie excited, and wanting to be scared which isn't hard to do. The first 20 minutes or so were great. The sets and wardrobe were full of vibrant colors, the soundtrack was good (only in the beginning, more on that later), the acting was great and the jokes seemed organic. The buildup in the beginning was very suspenseful, not relying on cheap jump scares at all. And then things to a turn for the worse.... way worse!The shadowy figures finally made their appearance in the movie, everything is still suspenseful and the action scenes are playing out beautifully, and then the shadows start talking. I'm thinking what the hell is going on? Is this supposed to be scary? What they're saying makes no sense and isn't relevant in the slightest. Scene after scene is happening with no direction, no explanation, and no real purpose. The suspense is gone, and it is replaced with mindless screaming and action scenes which are not scary at all, it's just feels stupid. Kind of like the action scenes from ""The Purge"", a lot of things happening and people screaming, but at the same time nothing is happening, nothing is moving the story along.It seems like the villains in the movie can't make up their mind on what they're trying to accomplish. Do they want the family dead or not? And then the jokes in which everyone was laughing at in the first 20 minutes in the movie disappeared, and was replaced with dialogue that just kept getting cheesier and cheesier. I just didn't know what they were trying to do with this movie. I kept waiting for it to get better but it just kept getting worse and worse. The plot was non existent.The villains would corner their victims, and not kill them when they had the opportunity, they would just act like they're trying to hurt them, make a few creepy faces and stupid noises and then just let them go. This happened over and over until it got soo tiresome that you just wanted something, anything significant to happen. When people died, you could care less because they felt like expendable characters. And the whole time your watching the film, your waiting for the film to give you a clue as to what is happening and why. And then the soundtrack started sounding weird, not scary, just weird. As if they just asked a random five year old off the street to pick what they would think of as creepy music to go with the movie.Then there were symbols that not only had no meaning but felt stupid, think bunnies and weird wanna be scary but still childish music. You'll see. The ending of the film reminded me of some of M. Night Shyamalan's not so good endings. There was a twist, but it just leaves you scratching your head in confusion, and feeling anger because it makes zero sense and doesn't explain anything about the previous 2 hours you just witnessed. Then we go back to this game of ""I wanna kill you, but I don't wanna kill you!, I just wanna freak you out a little and carelessly give you the upper hand when I didn't need to"". During these final scenes there were so many WTF moments, that reminded you that you were watching a movie because it was not believable at all.My conclusion, the beginning was an awesome buildup to what could've been a great movie. Action scenes were happening that kept you interested to see what happens next. Then what happens next is the same tireless cat and mouse game over and over. In the midst of all this you're still waiting for an explanation that never comes, and witness a twist that doesn't make sense. The movie is over and you come to the realization that you just wasted 2 hours of your life and that the best thing about the movie was the trailer.Horror fans won't like this, drama fan's won't like this, and the casual movie goer will definitely not like this.So should you Watch it or skip it? I say save your money and skip this movie. You couldn't pay me to watch this movie again. Final Score: 3/10",2
Us,"If the name wasn't Jordan Peele, you would have walked out of that theater. Most of the audience went to see US because of the amazing experience they had with the successful movie Get Out.US starts with introducing us the family. The visuals are stunning, great score puts you right into the mood and there's a significant effort spent to make the characters likeable, up until the bad guys show up.Until here, everything is right and we feel like we're watching a Jordan Peele movie. Then, it takes a wrong turn and falls down flat on its face.The bad guys show up and as soon as Lupita's doppelgnger opens her mouth, the movie finishes for me. All of a sudden, I feel like I'm in a ridiculous movie made by a 13 year old. Her raspy voice sounded really stupid and cheesy rather than creepy.Although I liked some of the humor, I felt like some jokes straight up ruined the scene's ambiance:Okay. There is a family that looks exactly like you, standing right in front of you holding scissors, everyone looks scared to death and then you just have to say ""Please take the boat"", really now?Once I experienced these untimely jokes, it went downhill for me really fast. The chase and the combat scenes are far from being realistic and I started to feel like a Jordan Peele parody on YouTube rather than an original picture.The movie gets worse and worse after that and once things are being overly explained you scream WHAT? Because nothing makes sense and immediately you notice a plot hole after a plot hole.Like many revievers said before, this movie would have been much better if nothing was explained and left for our imagination. At least the plot would make some sort of sense.As for the acting, Nyongo puts an amazing performance. Although she plays two characters, you could swear the actors are different. She's that good. You could see every single emotion there's to exist on her facial expressions. Creepy? You got it. Sweet and caring? You got that too.However, the others were an epic fail. The dad was annoying with no mimics whatsoever, the girl overplayed the emotions almost every scene and the boy was too stiff.Overall, if you want to see a movie with great visuals and musical score everyone's talking about, then go see this movie to form your own opinion.But, if you say the movie you watch has to have a great story and should make sense, then wait for it to show up on a streaming network.4/10 for the visuals, soundtrack and some acting.",2
Us,It seems as if the movie can't decide if it wasn't to be funny or serious. It tries both and fails at both.,3
Us,"I actually liked this movie a lot. It wasn't what I had expected, and I didn't go into it thinking I was going to be scared. This is a thriller and there are multiple moments where you feel unsettled. I can see some points that other reviewers have pointed out, but I liked it and can't wait to watch it again to see if other things stand out!This movie is definitely not for everyone.",4
Us,"Not as good as i was hoping . I went into the cinema expecting a good horror movie of this year . I found the movie more of a comedy than a horror !! So , in the end it's another run-of-the-mill horror film despite having a great story !! So far , actress Lupita Nyong'o a.k.a Adelaide Wilson have a good acting performance in this movie !! So disappointed !!",3
Us,"It's got some originality but it lacks the hook you want. The trailer is worth watching more than the movie in my opinion. I give it a 7 for the acting and comedy throughout. The main character is wonderful and her husband is the comedic relief in tense situations, even the kids played their roles well. The movie however, was all over the place. I don't think anyone in the theater really understood the premise until it was over and even then you're left shrugging. It's like the reverse of an early M. Night Shyamalan twist.",4
Us,"The beginning was alright. Great actors.
But there were just too many WTF moments. Everyone's stabbing each other and I can't help but laugh, because the plot is that ridiculous. I'm suprised it has such a high score amongst critics. It's just a marketing strategy, making people want to see it.",2
Us,"The scenario seems like have written by a 11 yo child from Beverly Hills. I couldn't find neither logic nor a decent fiction in it. In addition, the end was irrelevant. I'm not a fastidious person but the movie was simply bad! It doesn't deserve over 5!",2
Us,"I struggled to like much in this. Good cast but performed badly in large parts with over acting to try and be scary being the worst thing.
The Plot started well and was intriguing but the more it went on on I actually found it laughable. By the time it hit a big a twist at the end I didn't care. Plus point of the film was the child actors were impressive.",2
Us,"This is what happens when a novice film maker makes a fresh original film (""Get Out""), it becomes a hit and he wins an Oscar; he is then given carte blanche on his next project. This movie is truly terrible. It has no exposition, nothing make sense and nothing is explained. I saw it in IMAX which made it three times as painful to watch. Believe me having root canal surgery that hits a nerve is more enjoyable. I give the publicists credit for passing this off as the next sensation....Now the public can judge this catastrophe!",1
Us,"I was concerned that after Get Out that there would be no way that this movie could live up to that work of art, nor could it equal the hype. That's been the problem with so many elevated horror films of the past few years, movies that were so hyped that they couldn't help but be vaporware on celluloid, ciphers of films that barely hold interest much less devotion.Writer/director/producer Jordan Peele has stated that he was dismayed by the genre confusion of Get Out, so he opted to make a full-on horror film as his follow-up. Unlike nearly every horror movie I've seen in a theater for the past two years, I'm happy to report he's succeeded. The packed house we saw the film in was only too happy to scream out loud, yell things at the scream and react to every story beat as a horror movie audience should.Unlike a movie like last year's Halloween, Us is all about the terror of someone coming after you. There are numerous instances of stalking here that add up to true tension - as a horror movie should. It's also a testament to Peele's growing skills as a storyteller that there's so much humanity under what's also a pretty darn great popcorn movie.The film starts with a TV showing us commercials for the beachfront at Santa Cruz and Hands Across America, the May 25, 1985 benefit and PR stunt where 6.5 million people held hands for fifteen minutes, creating a human chain across the United States. If you look closely, several VHS movies are on the shelf: The Right Stuff, The Man with Two Brains (a nod to Get Out), The Goonies (one of the evil twins yells, ""It's our time now!"" a Corey Feldman quote from this film) and C.H.U.D.Between the quote that opens the film about tunnels under America and this VHS box, what happens next shouldn't be a total surprise. Those Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers were all the rage in the mid-80's, as that film and whether or not it could be true were hotly debated topics in my teen years. It's also a movie directed by Douglas Cheek - the father of Peele's first girlfriend.We then discover the film's heroine, Adelaide Thomas, on a beach vacation with her parents. The film even cleverly references another film that deals with the terrors of the boardwalk, The Lost Boys, by having Adelaide's mother say, ""You know, they're shooting a movie over there by the carousel.""Wandering off on her own, the young girl enters a hall of mirrors where she meets her doppelganger, a moment that we only see in small bursts until the end of the film. She becomes traumatized by the experience and it's only through becoming a dancer that she is able to express her emotions and move on.In the here and now, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o, Black Panther), her husband Gabe (Winston Duke, also of Black Panther and someone who feels like the voice of one of Peele's comedy characters at numerous points in the film) and their children, Zora and Jason are on their way to that very same beach. Adelaide is content to stay in the beach house and never go to the boardwalk, but her husband begs them to go to the boardwalk to hang out with another family, the Tylers (which is made up of Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss as the mother, Tim Heidecker from Tim and Eric as the dad, and their twin daughters).Adelaide has been on edge all day. The man she saw as a child carrying a Jeremiah 11:11 sign is now a dead body being loaded onto an ambulance. And that Bible passage - ""Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them."" - doesn't seem like a portent of anything good happening. That quote - and the 11:11 duality - is also referenced in the digital clock shown before the power goes out later in the film. A trivia note here: the doppelganger that replaces the man with the sign even has 11:11 scratched into his forehead.This is a film based on duality and the scene that follows repeats the same journey that Adelaide made as a child, now with her son Jason wandering off, as he finds a stranger dripping blood. She instantly freaks out and gives chase, finding him and forcing her family to leave the beach.That night, she demands that the family cut their vacation short. But then, the power is cut and the movie does what horror does best: drop the bottom out. Reality is no longer what you expect and now, a family that looks exactly like the Wilsons are on the front doorstep of their home. The police are fourteen minutes away, but that may as well be a lifetime.This cracked mirror version of our heroes goes after the family with a vengeance. Adelaide is handcuffed to the living room table by Red, the leader. Zora, who wanted to quit track, is now chased on foot by Umbrae (the name literally means inner darkness or an eclipse). Gabe is dragged across broken glass and taken outside by Abraham. And Jason is pulled into a closet by the burned and scarred Pluto (the smallest of the planets, but also the name for the god of the underworld).Each member of the family must deal with their duplicates on their own. Gabe, who has been a comedy figure and obsessed with his barely operating boat, uses said nautical craft to effectively murder his twin. Jason is able to realize that he can use his duality with Pluto to trap him in the closet, which gives his family time to escape to the boat.Here's where this movie gets even better: when the family makes their way to the home of the Tylers, we soon realize that the shadow versions aren't unique to our hero family. No, everyone has one of these twins and they've all started to rise from the underworld with murderous intentions. Now, the creatures known as the Tethered are killing their surface world sides and forming a human chain.Umbrae attacks the family as they drive off, but Zora uses the car - and not her human running ability - to kill her. But as they get to the boardwalk, the road is blocked by Pluto who has set fire to numerous cars and traps the family. Jason realizes that he's still tied to the boy, so he makes him walk into the flames before Red kidnaps him.Adelaide follows her twin through the hall of mirrors and then deeper and deeper into the earth, passing the cages of rabbits which we saw in the title sequence. Now, we learn that the Tethered were a government creation, made to control people before being abandoned. Now, they are forced to remain in the shadows, stuck replicating the motions of their free twins above ground. Once Adelaide and Red met in 1986, their connection was a message from God that Red must lead the Tethered into the light.Again, any other movie would stop here. The ideas are big enough. But like the best in horror, reality can be further destroyed by the real duality of the film: the heroine that we've been behind the entire film is actually the doppelganger. The real Adelaide is the one who has led the uprising, with the 1986 Hands Across America action as her childhood vision of what adults do to make a statement. Only Jason realizes this, as he slides his monster mask down on his face (I love how he constantly wears this, much like Frankie wearing the Dracula mask throughout The Lady in White).The final thing we see is the family driving an ambulance into a burning city, surrounded by helicopters and the human chain of the Tethered stretching out into the horizon.For all the talk of movies appearing to be John Carpenter influenced, this is the most Carpenter film I've seen that he didn't direct. It has all the elements - a group under attack by forces they don't understand, evil that wants to destroy you for no reason other than it wants you dead and an ending that appears as positive as it does negative. There's an underlying menace in Us that Carpenter's films have and few others can achieve.Peele gave the cast ten horror films to watch so they would have a shared language when filming this movie: Dead Again, The Shining, The Babadook, It Follows, A Tale of Two Sisters, The Birds, Funny Games, Martyrs, Let the Right One In and The Sixth Sense. I believed this allowed them to easily create a language of their own. Peele has also called out a direct inspiration for this movie came from The Twilight Zone episode ""Mirror Image,"" in which a woman sees her twin at a train station and becomes obsessed with the fact that her evil side is trying to replace her.Some may decry this movie for how it leaves so much unexplained: how could there be an entire world under ours, where people do the same actions as us, trapped to live in our shadow? Why do we need an explanation spelled out to us? Why can't we accept this premise and enjoy where it takes us?Me, I'm wondering what the symbolism of having two Black Flag shirts - the logo shirt and the My War shirt, an album that divided the band's fanbase due to it being more Black Sabbath than fast punk rock - means. I was probably the only person in the theater concerned with such things. In fact, clothing is a big part of this movie, with the Michael Jackson Thriller shirt symbolizing the strange duality of the childlike Michael and his horrific red-clad zombie twin in the music video. In fact, Peele has referred to Jackson as ""the patron saint of duality."" Hell, the Tethered wear the same red as Jackson and also have one glove on their hands.My favorite part of this movie is that it explores the dark side of the neon hue of the 80's. Even Hands Across America - an effort to bring people together and raise money for charity - always seemed creepy to me. I wasn't alone. As Peele told the L.A. Times, ""There was this kind of almost Stepford-creepy sense of American hope that we can do anything as long as we just hold our hands together.""Obviously, I've put plenty of throught into this film. What I've come out with is that Peele is no one trick pony. I'm pleased to report that Us only confirms what Get Out hinted at.",5
Us,"Why do characters intentionally put themselves in danger. Why does the mum go looking for the doppelganger daughter in the woods after she was knocked down, why not just continue driving.
Given the choice between running over the doppelganger son or fighting him with a weapon she chooses the latter.
The film was a massive let down in comparison to Get Out. Wait till it's available on Netflix or Sky, don't waste your money going to the cinema",2
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"I liked the movie a lot. I thought it was very well shot and very well acted, and I can appreciate Peele's subtle homages to previous horror films throughout. However, the story itself is very weak and a bit of a mess.A big concern for the main characters, as well as for the viewers, is why these doppelgngers (known in the movie as The Tethered) are attacking. So we are lead from almost the beginning, to want those answers, and when they're actually delivered, it's pretty unsatisfying.The logic (or lackthereof) of The Tethered's existence and motivation is very messy and ultimately ruins the final conclusion of the film, because it leaves too many holes in the story that need to be answered.If Peele had removed the explanation element as to the Tethered's existence, functionality etc. it would have made it a better story in my opinion. It becomes then a survival horror film, and leaves more to the viewer's imagination and thoughts as to the how and why, and that could even leave some good opportunities for symbolism etc. which Peele is known for. Not to mention it would have made the final conclusion even more shocking, compelling and thought provoking, and viewers would be talking about it for a long time, in all the best ways. Instead we're left talking about the many plot holes in the explanation.All in all, as a standalone movie, it's really good and I can appreciate it for what it is, despite some of it's plot points I'd like further explanation on.Also, I don't really think it can or should be compared to Get Out in any way because they're two completely different films, in genre and the overall tone. Us is a horror film and Get Out is a social thriller. So it's unfair to pit them against each other, or put them in the same league, even though they share the same director. I feel like people looking to do that are going to end up disappointed with this movie no matter what.",4
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"Trailer was better than the movie. To me this movie just never takes off. It's a shame because there is some fantastic imagery and a wonderful theme lying underneath but in the end it can not overcome its plot holes and failed delivery of the message its trying to speak. It truly believes it's deeper than it is, but left me unfulfilled. Kind of lazy/rushed writing in my opinion. Kind of just throws a bunch of mediocre stuff at you without any real substance and expects the audience to give it purpose and deeper meaning in there own heads. Which is fine to do but to me this movie wasn't worthy of that merit of thought. You keep waiting for it to evolve but it just never does. Honestly can't believe critics are putting this on such a pedestal giving it such rave reviews.",3
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"I am torn on whether or not I like the story of Us. Part of me really likes the originality of the idea and the subtle social commentary the film delivers; however, I felt that despite Us having an interesting idea, the execution led to a disjointed story that felt a bit scatterbrained. There were definitely parts of the film that were suspenseful and horrifying, but at the same time, other parts felt too over-explained or tropey. This leads to me having many unanswered questions about certain aspects and feeling like other aspects shouldn't have been explained at all to keep the mystery. I think the story is hard to talk about without spoiling it, but overall, I expected more from Jordan Peele's writing but did enjoy some of it.Despite my indecisive feelings of the film's story, many pieces of the film were exceptionally well done. One aspect that stood out in Us was the soundtrack and the usage of music. I think the original soundtrack was memorable and used appropriately to accentuate the feeling of horror at some points in the film. On the flip side, the soundtrack was used to perfectly contrast what was going on onscreen. This led to some great sequences (the Beach Boys scene) that utilized the soundtrack in an interesting way. Another part of the film that I really enjoyed was Lupita Nyong'o and the child actors' performances. Nyong'o in particular is the most terrifying part of the film. She plays both a horrific monster and a badass mother, making it easy to forget that the same actor plays them.As a whole, I think Us is an enjoyable horror film that has some missteps with its story elements and structure. I would recommend this film to horror fans, but don't go into the film expecting anything like Get Out.",4
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"I understand what was trying to be achieved but it fell flat.This movie reminded me of movies like the mist or cloverfield. There is this underlying plot of ""sci-fi experiment gone wrong"" that doesn't get explained. However in this film we get a small but lazy explanation. This came in the form of a text card at the beginning of the film that basically reads ""There thousands of tunnels in the world. Who knows what's in them"". This was the movies only explanation and setup for a civilization of 6 million clones of people living in an underground tunnel. When the movie ended and it pieced together to be this it made for an overarching plot that was just stupid.Now these clones did refer to themselves as shadows because they were sometimes forced to mimic the movements of the person they are cloned after. It was weird how selective that was and is very inconsistent in a way that hurt a couple scenes in the movie.The rest of the movie is just those 6 million clones coming out of the tunnel and killing the person they are cloned after. Once they accomplish that they hold hands and form a line stretching across the United States. And no I'm not kidding, this is exactly how the movie ends.The only redeeming qualities was good acting, good music, and decent humor. However, none of that can fix a terrible plot that ended with an nonsensical twist. Like a sour cherry ontop.",2
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"I am sure that this review is going to get a ton of down votes and I am pretty sure that all those 10/10 reviews are bot accounts (if you dont believe me check the profiles) so I wont spent much time analyzing the film. Many many plot holes,little substance and ultimately you have a movie with a weak script based on a good idea that takes itself way to seriously without achieving even half of what it promises. Get out worked that well because it didn't take itself that seriously and there was always an underlying tone of dark comedy to it. It gets a 5 because I liked the cinematography and I thought that the performances where actually quite good!",3
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"Like other reviewers, first 20-30 minutes was good and then when the doppelgnger started speaking, it went downhill from there. It was slow, longer than it should have been, pretentious, and by the end boring. The dumb screeching from the doppelgngers, the lack of a good script (some parts made absolutely no sense), the attempt to be both funny and scary at the same time... My husband and I almost fell asleep at the end! Is that what a good horror/thriller should do to you? We had such high hopes for this film and both left disappointed. Not sure how people are rating it even close to a 10. I've never left a movie review before so imagine how disappointed I was to leave this. The only good thing is that the movie was free because we had a gift card.",2
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),Was excited to watch this movie with all the hype surrounding it. The first 20 mins or so was on par with my expectations and then it just fell flat on its face. Not nearly as good as Get Out. Way to many plot holes and un answered questions. Acting was decent and writing was average. Some funny parts and the soundtrack are the only thing that really saves this movie from being a 3 or a 4.,3
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"People thinking this will be a straight-forward horror film will be disappointed; Us (2019) is a complex, mind bending experience that tests the limitations of what a horror film can be. What's great about the film is how differently people will interpret what they've witnessed. I left the theater tonight to the sounds of people passionately discussing theories, different explanations and thoughts on it all - and that, to me, is one of the great joys in leaving a great film.",4
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"I hate saying this, but this film is the product of when you've got incredible everything and an underdeveloped script. The concepts are great, but lose their value and appreciation because there is so much with so little explanation, leaving me with the impression that they were not completely thought-out.
Acting was incredible, cinematography, lighting, set design, and sound track were wonderful too! It's just that the script and story does not fully deliver. It's so conceptual that it loses horror, yet so rushed in execution that it loses coherence.",3
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"Jordan Peele is at it again!Hard to say too much about this one without spoiling, but here goes.
The acting is good, especially considering many of the actors plays two roles. They all do a bang up job in that regard. So no trouble so far.
The movie looks good. I have no complains here either. It's technically very well made. We always see what's going on, no shaky cam or anything like that. Some nice shots too.
The humor works pretty well, the dialogue comes off as natural.
I like the beginning of the movie, the family is pretty likable.
The movie is sort of a mystery, and when the mystery unravels is when we get to some slight problems. The scrips seems to be based on a pretty good idea, that was never thoroughly worked out. It just isn't thought all the way through.
I am left with several questions, and not in a good way.
This is spoiler terriroty, so I won't go into detail, but it didn't sit well with me. Doesn't seem to make sense. The plot has more holes than a swizz cheese. (that almost no critics talk about this is very strange)Now, in the movies defence, the sub-genre it turne out to be is very far from my favorite, so others might like it better. I've seen a lot of horror movies, and this is just not one of the best ones. It is mediocre.
Not a weak movie, but definitely no classic. Will not be watching it again.",3
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"All I can say is cringe cringe cringe. The ""demonic voices"" and terrible plot made me laugh (and die a little inside) the entire movie...that's all I have to say. Way over rated film...",2
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"All this movie wants you to do is go on the internet afterwards and read the 75 million different theories people have about it.Also to call this a ""horror movie"" is comical. Dumbest movie I've seen in a while.",2
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"Where do I start with this review? This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life, and I have watched a lot of movies. I came into this movie excited, and wanting to be scared which isn't hard to do. The first 20 minutes or so were great. The sets and wardrobe were full of vibrant colors, the soundtrack was good (only in the beginning, more on that later), the acting was great and the jokes seemed organic. The buildup in the beginning was very suspenseful, not relying on cheap jump scares at all. And then things to a turn for the worse.... way worse!The shadowy figures finally made their appearance in the movie, everything is still suspenseful and the action scenes are playing out beautifully, and then the shadows start talking. I'm thinking what the hell is going on? Is this supposed to be scary? What they're saying makes no sense and isn't relevant in the slightest. Scene after scene is happening with no direction, no explanation, and no real purpose. The suspense is gone, and it is replaced with mindless screaming and action scenes which are not scary at all, it's just feels stupid. Kind of like the action scenes from ""The Purge"", a lot of things happening and people screaming, but at the same time nothing is happening, nothing is moving the story along.It seems like the villains in the movie can't make up their mind on what they're trying to accomplish. Do they want the family dead or not? And then the jokes in which everyone was laughing at in the first 20 minutes in the movie disappeared, and was replaced with dialogue that just kept getting cheesier and cheesier. I just didn't know what they were trying to do with this movie. I kept waiting for it to get better but it just kept getting worse and worse. The plot was non existent.The villains would corner their victims, and not kill them when they had the opportunity, they would just act like they're trying to hurt them, make a few creepy faces and stupid noises and then just let them go. This happened over and over until it got soo tiresome that you just wanted something, anything significant to happen. When people died, you could care less because they felt like expendable characters. And the whole time your watching the film, your waiting for the film to give you a clue as to what is happening and why. And then the soundtrack started sounding weird, not scary, just weird. As if they just asked a random five year old off the street to pick what they would think of as creepy music to go with the movie.Then there were symbols that not only had no meaning but felt stupid, think bunnies and weird wanna be scary but still childish music. You'll see. The ending of the film reminded me of some of M. Night Shyamalan's not so good endings. There was a twist, but it just leaves you scratching your head in confusion, and feeling anger because it makes zero sense and doesn't explain anything about the previous 2 hours you just witnessed. Then we go back to this game of ""I wanna kill you, but I don't wanna kill you!, I just wanna freak you out a little and carelessly give you the upper hand when I didn't need to"". During these final scenes there were so many WTF moments, that reminded you that you were watching a movie because it was not believable at all.My conclusion, the beginning was an awesome buildup to what could've been a great movie. Action scenes were happening that kept you interested to see what happens next. Then what happens next is the same tireless cat and mouse game over and over. In the midst of all this you're still waiting for an explanation that never comes, and witness a twist that doesn't make sense. The movie is over and you come to the realization that you just wasted 2 hours of your life and that the best thing about the movie was the trailer.Horror fans won't like this, drama fan's won't like this, and the casual movie goer will definitely not like this.So should you Watch it or skip it? I say save your money and skip this movie. You couldn't pay me to watch this movie again. Final Score: 3/10",2
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"If the name wasn't Jordan Peele, you would have walked out of that theater. Most of the audience went to see US because of the amazing experience they had with the successful movie Get Out.US starts with introducing us the family. The visuals are stunning, great score puts you right into the mood and there's a significant effort spent to make the characters likeable, up until the bad guys show up.Until here, everything is right and we feel like we're watching a Jordan Peele movie. Then, it takes a wrong turn and falls down flat on its face.The bad guys show up and as soon as Lupita's doppelgnger opens her mouth, the movie finishes for me. All of a sudden, I feel like I'm in a ridiculous movie made by a 13 year old. Her raspy voice sounded really stupid and cheesy rather than creepy.Although I liked some of the humor, I felt like some jokes straight up ruined the scene's ambiance:Okay. There is a family that looks exactly like you, standing right in front of you holding scissors, everyone looks scared to death and then you just have to say ""Please take the boat"", really now?Once I experienced these untimely jokes, it went downhill for me really fast. The chase and the combat scenes are far from being realistic and I started to feel like a Jordan Peele parody on YouTube rather than an original picture.The movie gets worse and worse after that and once things are being overly explained you scream WHAT? Because nothing makes sense and immediately you notice a plot hole after a plot hole.Like many revievers said before, this movie would have been much better if nothing was explained and left for our imagination. At least the plot would make some sort of sense.As for the acting, Nyongo puts an amazing performance. Although she plays two characters, you could swear the actors are different. She's that good. You could see every single emotion there's to exist on her facial expressions. Creepy? You got it. Sweet and caring? You got that too.However, the others were an epic fail. The dad was annoying with no mimics whatsoever, the girl overplayed the emotions almost every scene and the boy was too stiff.Overall, if you want to see a movie with great visuals and musical score everyone's talking about, then go see this movie to form your own opinion.But, if you say the movie you watch has to have a great story and should make sense, then wait for it to show up on a streaming network.4/10 for the visuals, soundtrack and some acting.",2

That's been the problem with so many elevated horror films of the past few years, movies that were so hyped that they couldn't help but be vaporware on celluloid, ciphers of films that barely hold interest much less devotion.Writer/director/producer Jordan Peele has stated that he was dismayed by the genre confusion of Get Out, so he opted to make a full-on horror film as his follow-up. Unlike nearly every horror movie I've seen in a theater for the past two years, I'm happy to report he's succeeded. The packed house we saw the film in was only too happy to scream out loud, yell things at the scream and react to every story beat as a horror movie audience should.Unlike a movie like last year's Halloween, Us is all about the terror of someone coming after you. There are numerous instances of stalking here that add up to true tension - as a horror movie should. It's also a testament to Peele's growing skills as a storyteller that there's so much humanity under what's also a pretty darn great popcorn movie.The film starts with a TV showing us commercials for the beachfront at Santa Cruz and Hands Across America, the May 25, 1985 benefit and PR stunt where 6.5 million people held hands for fifteen minutes, creating a human chain across the United States. If you look closely, several VHS movies are on the shelf: The Right Stuff, The Man with Two Brains (a nod to Get Out), The Goonies (one of the evil twins yells, ""It's our time now!"" a Corey Feldman quote from this film) and C.H.U.D.Between the quote that opens the film about tunnels under America and this VHS box, what happens next shouldn't be a total surprise. Those Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers were all the rage in the mid-80's, as that film and whether or not it could be true were hotly debated topics in my teen years. It's also a movie directed by Douglas Cheek - the father of Peele's first girlfriend.We then discover the film's heroine, Adelaide Thomas, on a beach vacation with her parents. The film even cleverly references another film that deals with the terrors of the boardwalk, The Lost Boys, by having Adelaide's mother say, ""You know, they're shooting a movie over there by the carousel.""Wandering off on her own, the young girl enters a hall of mirrors where she meets her doppelganger, a moment that we only see in small bursts until the end of the film. She becomes traumatized by the experience and it's only through becoming a dancer that she is able to express her emotions and move on.In the here and now, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o, Black Panther), her husband Gabe (Winston Duke, also of Black Panther and someone who feels like the voice of one of Peele's comedy characters at numerous points in the film) and their children, Zora and Jason are on their way to that very same beach. Adelaide is content to stay in the beach house and never go to the boardwalk, but her husband begs them to go to the boardwalk to hang out with another family, the Tylers (which is made up of Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss as the mother, Tim Heidecker from Tim and Eric as the dad, and their twin daughters).Adelaide has been on edge all day. The man she saw as a child carrying a Jeremiah 11:11 sign is now a dead body being loaded onto an ambulance. And that Bible passage - ""Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them."" - doesn't seem like a portent of anything good happening. That quote - and the 11:11 duality - is also referenced in the digital clock shown before the power goes out later in the film. A trivia note here: the doppelganger that replaces the man with the sign even has 11:11 scratched into his forehead.This is a film based on duality and the scene that follows repeats the same journey that Adelaide made as a child, now with her son Jason wandering off, as he finds a stranger dripping blood. She instantly freaks out and gives chase, finding him and forcing her family to leave the beach.That night, she demands that the family cut their vacation short. But then, the power is cut and the movie does what horror does best: drop the bottom out. Reality is no longer what you expect and now, a family that looks exactly like the Wilsons are on the front doorstep of their home. The police are fourteen minutes away, but that may as well be a lifetime.This cracked mirror version of our heroes goes after the family with a vengeance. Adelaide is handcuffed to the living room table by Red, the leader. Zora, who wanted to quit track, is now chased on foot by Umbrae (the name literally means inner darkness or an eclipse). Gabe is dragged across broken glass and taken outside by Abraham. And Jason is pulled into a closet by the burned and scarred Pluto (the smallest of the planets, but also the name for the god of the underworld).Each member of the family must deal with their duplicates on their own. Gabe, who has been a comedy figure and obsessed with his barely operating boat, uses said nautical craft to effectively murder his twin. Jason is able to realize that he can use his duality with Pluto to trap him in the closet, which gives his family time to escape to the boat.Here's where this movie gets even better: when the family makes their way to the home of the Tylers, we soon realize that the shadow versions aren't unique to our hero family. No, everyone has one of these twins and they've all started to rise from the underworld with murderous intentions. Now, the creatures known as the Tethered are killing their surface world sides and forming a human chain.Umbrae attacks the family as they drive off, but Zora uses the car - and not her human running ability - to kill her. But as they get to the boardwalk, the road is blocked by Pluto who has set fire to numerous cars and traps the family. Jason realizes that he's still tied to the boy, so he makes him walk into the flames before Red kidnaps him.Adelaide follows her twin through the hall of mirrors and then deeper and deeper into the earth, passing the cages of rabbits which we saw in the title sequence. Now, we learn that the Tethered were a government creation, made to control people before being abandoned. Now, they are forced to remain in the shadows, stuck replicating the motions of their free twins above ground. Once Adelaide and Red met in 1986, their connection was a message from God that Red must lead the Tethered into the light.Again, any other movie would stop here. The ideas are big enough. But like the best in horror, reality can be further destroyed by the real duality of the film: the heroine that we've been behind the entire film is actually the doppelganger. The real Adelaide is the one who has led the uprising, with the 1986 Hands Across America action as her childhood vision of what adults do to make a statement. Only Jason realizes this, as he slides his monster mask down on his face (I love how he constantly wears this, much like Frankie wearing the Dracula mask throughout The Lady in White).The final thing we see is the family driving an ambulance into a burning city, surrounded by helicopters and the human chain of the Tethered stretching out into the horizon.For all the talk of movies appearing to be John Carpenter influenced, this is the most Carpenter film I've seen that he didn't direct. It has all the elements - a group under attack by forces they don't understand, evil that wants to destroy you for no reason other than it wants you dead and an ending that appears as positive as it does negative. There's an underlying menace in Us that Carpenter's films have and few others can achieve.Peele gave the cast ten horror films to watch so they would have a shared language when filming this movie: Dead Again, The Shining, The Babadook, It Follows, A Tale of Two Sisters, The Birds, Funny Games, Martyrs, Let the Right One In and The Sixth Sense. I believed this allowed them to easily create a language of their own. Peele has also called out a direct inspiration for this movie came from The Twilight Zone episode ""Mirror Image,"" in which a woman sees her twin at a train station and becomes obsessed with the fact that her evil side is trying to replace her.Some may decry this movie for how it leaves so much unexplained: how could there be an entire world under ours, where people do the same actions as us, trapped to live in our shadow? Why do we need an explanation spelled out to us? Why can't we accept this premise and enjoy where it takes us?Me, I'm wondering what the symbolism of having two Black Flag shirts - the logo shirt and the My War shirt, an album that divided the band's fanbase due to it being more Black Sabbath than fast punk rock - means. I was probably the only person in the theater concerned with such things. In fact, clothing is a big part of this movie, with the Michael Jackson Thriller shirt symbolizing the strange duality of the childlike Michael and his horrific red-clad zombie twin in the music video. In fact, Peele has referred to Jackson as ""the patron saint of duality."" Hell, the Tethered wear the same red as Jackson and also have one glove on their hands.My favorite part of this movie is that it explores the dark side of the neon hue of the 80's. Even Hands Across America - an effort to bring people together and raise money for charity - always seemed creepy to me. I wasn't alone. As Peele told the L.A. Times, ""There was this kind of almost Stepford-creepy sense of American hope that we can do anything as long as we just hold our hands together.""Obviously, I've put plenty of throught into this film. What I've come out with is that Peele is no one trick pony. I'm pleased to report that Us only confirms what Get Out hinted at.",5
Betiyon Ki Balle Balle (Kargil Se Kanyakumari),"Why do characters intentionally put themselves in danger. Why does the mum go looking for the doppelganger daughter in the woods after she was knocked down, why not just continue driving.
Given the choice between running over the doppelganger son or fighting him with a weapon she chooses the latter.
The film was a massive let down in comparison to Get Out. Wait till it's available on Netflix or Sky, don't waste your money going to the cinema",2
Gully Boy,Was never a fan of rap or ranveer singh but this film has totally floored me. On the surface it seems like a rags to riches story but it's so much more. Truly poetry on celluloid. Ranveer does a Bhachan esk performance. It's all I'm his eyes. Just masterful acting cannot believe this is the same guy who played Khilji? ??,5
Gully Boy,"NO ITS NOT COPIED FROM 8 MILE. Did you guys watch 8 mile and Gully Boy both?if you do think they are the same, then you need learn how to watch movies before you compare them. You also need to understand what a movie genre means. May be search in google to get better understanding.you all are saying 8 mile and Gully Boy are the same based on just few things as both movies are about rappers and their struggles. its like calling all the love stories are same because there is a boy and a girl in the movie.From the above rating you can see I liked Gully Boy, music and performances are very good. rapping looks natural. Alia Bhatt is a fire cracker in the movie. I just wish there is lot more to the story. its a worth a watch. Please dont listen to anyone who says its copied from 8 mile, watch both movies to decide for yourself.",4
Gully Boy,"Gully Boy merges into you and makes you feel as a part of Murad's journey (Ranveer Singh).
Dharavi 17 is where he stays and his daily struggles,his exposure to rap, his love life, a mistake in relationship,his guide,his well-wisher,his bonding with parents..
A common man's journey actually.
We all have such stories in our life.
Zoya has brilliantly captured the gully life here and shows how it moulds oneself with the amount of time you spend with people around you.With every movie this guy gets better.So once again Ranveer does his one of career's best.
Alia is the show stealer with dialogues that gets the whistle. We have three supporting Vijays here in this movie Vijay Raaz(father),Vijay Maurya(Uncle),Vijay Varma(Friend) and they are spot on.
Amruta Subash(mother) expresses her life's melancholy brilliantly.Kalki as sky gets limited screen time but packs a punch and last but not the least
the game changer Siddhant Chaturvedi(MC Sher). He overpowers Ranveer in many scenes.I won't stop if I start mentioning how apt and brilliant is the screenplay here..
Cinematography by Jay Oza and crisp editing by Nitin Baid are felt on the screen as the movie even being slow in pace doesn't be a boring affair in 2 hrs 35 mins.
Zoya has struck a win win here.Finally, what made it more lively was screen time for real life rappers like Emiway Bantaai,Stony Psycho and Dope Daddy from Dopedealicz , Kaambhaari and also a second of Brodha V.Just felt like saying this that how well the hip hop culture has been able to connect with our generation. Emiway Bantaai's one second presence in first half and the crowd erupted like never seen before. Also , his acts in second half are treat to watch. Not to forget Kaam Bhaari is there too.All in all 9/10 from my side.
Go for it folks.
Watch it for a beautiful journey of the guy from streets.",5
Gully Boy,"It's not about only a rap,it's about every person who struggles their own inside.its the story about every struggling person who trapped under the bloody society.who want to fly,who want to go outside,who want do something.its not a rap movie,it's truly a inspirational movie.",5
Gully Boy,"This is such a beautifully made film. It's very rare that one walks out of a film thinking of the world in a different way. When the film starts to the end, the director(Zoya Akhtar), makes sure the audience is hooked. Dialogue writer Vijay Maurya, also played by Murad(Ranveer's uncle) wrote some amazing dialogues and a script that not only neatly ties on the gully boy himself, but his love interest, relationships with his family, friends, and his inner demons.
Ranveer has slowly become Indian's Daniel Day Lewis. There is no trace of him in Murad. He is sensitive, daring, intense, and quiet. He breaths fire as he sits in his car, and raps his heart and arms out. He is brooding as he sits and writes after he sees his father's second wife come in his home. He doesn't miss a beat. Alia is growing from strength to strength. After, Udta, Dear Zindagi, Raazi, and now Gully Boy, is the latest in her kitty of great performances. A special mention to Siddarth and Vijay Varma for giving us such lovely characters to root for. Also Vijay Raaz as the abusive father. I hated him and that's a testament to how great Raaz is as an artist.
This movie is a must see. Go in and you'll be happy to spend Valentine's Day with Zoya and her team whom have gifted us this extradinary film. Hard Hai Boss!",5
Gully Boy,"Its an entertaining movie to watch for and is worth watching too..
Mostly the mumbaikers can relate to the movie as the whole movie is based in Dharavi.
Everyone is good with their character and it was great to see Vijay Raaz as always. He is indeed a very good actor.
To the one who don't understands the rap culture, the movie will be quite overrated but trust me its not.
To the one saying the movie is a copy of 8 miles must watch the movie, this is how the story of rapper can be exactly displayed.
And Ranveer was outstanding with his part and ""Apna Time Aayega"" is just outstanding work by Ranveer, If you feel the character then its also an inspiring story..
According to me its definitely worth watching :)
And the one calling Ranveer Singh's character as overacting are the one who don't understand Mumbai's local language",5
Gully Boy,"Must watch direction, screenplay ,acting everything is good in this movie",5
Gully Boy,"Almost every rap star came from hardships and poverty and that is what rap is, poetry of your life with awesome beats so what the hell were these morons expecting, a guy with no issues becoming a rap star - what was copied from 8 mile? i dare you to justify yourselves you stupid morons. Every part of the movie was awesome.",4
Gully Boy,"This is a perfect collage of stories told in the best possible way by zoya akhtar, it is also ranveer singh best acting ever. every frame is a treat.",5
Gully Boy,A story which justifies the hype it created before even releasing. There's alot to the other than just big names. The contribution of Zoya Akhtar's whole team is brilliant and is visible throughout. The film has a gripping narrative. It has a lot of parallel stories which are quite clear due to Zoya's brilliant directing. Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt have delivered great performances which were expected. Siddhant Chaturvedi is also a delight to watch. The authenticity of the film if commendable.,5
Gully Boy,"Zoya Akhtar has done it again. After helming some brilliant films like Luck By Chance, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and the underwhelming Dil Dhadakne Do, Zoya changes gear with Gully Boy. It's the story of Murad (Ranveer Singh), his aspiration, ambition, his family, his love Safeena (Alia Bhatt), his friendships and the path he takes to fulfil his dream. At the forefront, Gully Boy may seem like a movie about the underground rappers but actually, it is much more than that.The movie is mainly about human relations, connections, emotions and dynamics. There is no filmmaker better than Zoya Akhtar who can portray and handle human complexities in such a brilliant way. Gully Boy will surely be counted amongst her best work.Ranveer and Alia's chemistry is too cute to be true. They are like a house on fire.If the writing of the movie and Zoya's direction is of the highest order, Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, debutant Sidhant Chaturvedi and other actors compliment it with fabulous performances.Alia Bhatt, is the scene stealer. Every scene she appears in is a riot. She is endearing, to say the least. This is one of her best performances and her character is a crash course in women empowerment. I am sure everyone's gonna fall in love with her.On the downside though, the pacing takes a dip in the second half. And also the story in whole is quite predictable. The editing should've been tighter.Gully Boy is one of the best movies to come out of Indian cinema in recent times. Watch it for Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt's dazzling performances. And moreover, watch it for the master filmmaker Zoya Akhtar. Hats off to her. This one's a winner.",4
Gully Boy,"Saw the movie yesterday.. what an amazing and flawless film. I don't think I've truly experienced a film this close to heart. Every charcter, every frame is etched and performed to perfection. Murad, Safeena, Sher, Moeen - they all win your hearts. Brilliant supporting cast Amruta Subhash Vijay Raaz and others. Go watch it and give the movie Box office validation as such world-class film are made in rarity in the mainstream cinema. Gully Boy is an experience with music and Murad at it's core.",5
Gully Boy,Don't read any reviews just go and watch the film....And judge it yourself..,5
Gully Boy,"Ek number bhot hard bhot hard hattrick of blockbuster movies
1.padmavat-585.86 cr
2.Simmba -400 cr and on
3.Gully boy -???",5
Gully Boy,"The movie is really beautifully directed, the best part of the movie it shows the sad reality of our day to day life but regardless the movie is full of ""Junoon"" haha I forgot this word almost, love the music, love the direction, actually loved everything in the movie, every character is nicely played. Ranveer and Alia acting is deadly, vo kya bolte hai ""hard hai bhai"" :)
I understand this movie could be copy of 8 mile but hey trust me this is very different and can't be compared. In indian cinema it's hard to find a movie with natural acting and nice music and Gully boy is the one. Highly recommended movie!!",5
Gully Boy,"Was happy to see a new style (rapper-based) movie being produced by Bollywood. I am not a fan of such music, but can always appreciate a movie. And, honestly, that was the good part of the movie. Then there are side stories which were more like the 60's style and dragged the movie down - making it boring at times. Alia and Siddhant were the best. Ranveer decent. The finale was a bit let down. Just too much of celebration which didn't emotionally connect with me. I was happy that it was finally over. Compare this movie to Dangal, Secret Superstar, Chak De India, etc. and you will see that it lacks life.",4
Gully Boy,"Everyone have one movie in life which make them do something, change them, and help them discover themselves and for me GULLY BOY is that kind of movie. This is Ranveer Singh's best performance and best movie till date. The best part of this movie was there was no unwanted gimmicks done to show the character that 'only one' and who had gotten everything ready in his plate like one other recently released movie that came ;~)
Alia Bhatt like always was fabulous although there was not so much for her to do in this movie. All other cast were also great. And special mention for the writers of this movie who brought such a terrific plot in accordance with the character.",5
Gully Boy,"The similaritieswith 8 Mile is just in the basic premise and whatever was shown in the trailer. This film does stands on its own.
Simple story filled with complex characters (well all the characters from the Gully anyway) beautifully directed. Ranveer Singh is fantastic as expected. The only issue for me was that the climax could have been a bit more intense for such a story.",4
Gully Boy,"Dude I watched it , its overhyped believe me , it's a good movie , that's set , not the movie that u have to watch before you die , movie felt flat in between , & seemed boring at times , boy honestly speaking alia , & that second dude sidhant , over shadowed ranveer Singh , he has again overacted at times , so it's a good movie , but the way these critics & specially people in screening are portraying it it's not like that , so go watch it but just lower your expectations , its a damn honest review",3
Gully Boy,"Somewhere in between I felt as if it is copy of 8 miles and slumdog millionaire. However, the similarity is just in premise.",5
Gully Boy,Terrific movie! Lead actor Ranveer Singh 's performance is top notch and accolades worthy. Superbly directed movie,5
Gully Boy,"Left me speechless!!
Amazed by the actors
Everything is just perfect you should watch this for sure",5
Gully Boy,"The film is watchable for Zoya's direction and Siddhant's performance. There is nothing new in the film - it is the age-old underdog story, and I have seen much better depictions of the underdog story in world cinema. Some sections/ communities of the society may be able to connect with the film and its characters, but I could not. Also, if you are from Mumbai, you may like the film. In terms of performances, Ranveer is better here than in some of his last films. Alia has acted like she always does - just being the normal herself. The real performance for which to check out this film is Siddhant's. This is an actor to watch out for.
Disclaimer: There is too much rap in the film. I have tried to be as impartial in my review as possible - if you are not a fan of this so-called ""music"" like myself, you may not like it.",3
Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai?,"Manav Kaul and Nandita Das' remake of 1980's cult classic settles for a mediocre thriller which can't keep up with its characters - or their indignation.Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai? has an anti-establishment heart, but because of the somewhat outdated execution, it falls flat as a two-hour watch.",3
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Dilwale made me glad to be a Westerner, just so I could experience the sheer rush in the glorious way this film simply throws its Indian sensibility in your face. It is one of the most completely, openly joyful films I have ever seen. In many ways a totally Western film, it is yet completely un-Western, and absolutely invigorating.I found the (rather oddly looped in places) mix of Hindi and English dialog to be a lot of fun to follow (as incomplete as the subtitles sometimes seemed). The Indian/Western pop structure of the songs was entertaining and infectious. The choreography is simply amazing, and some of the most sheerly athletic I've seen. The Indian roots of the dance routines were at first almost unnerving--at once familiar yet bizarre, almost surreal (to my Western eyes). It was sheer fun making the cultural adjustment.The plot is predictable, almost pedestrian--certainly not what you'd call ""never done before,"" and yet I found myself completely absorbed in the story, and rooting for the main characters. This is in large part due to Shahrukh Khan's and Kajol's performances as Raj and Simran. He is totally endearing, and she is totally hot!, and their on screen chemistry is as cute & perky and smoldering & steamy as Fred and Ginger at their peak. It was, simply put, fun to watch them having so much fun.Director Aditya Chopra was, I understand, only 24 when he made Dilwale, and the film was so successful its Indian first run lasted a world-record 11 years (and may still be going on, as far as I know). A heckuva testimony to Bollywood indeed. This movie has instantly become one of my favorite musicals, and I look forward to finding more films from Chopra, Khan, and Kajol. What a treat!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Srk-Kajol have worked in a lot of blockbusters together(Baazigar, Karan Arjun, KKHH, K3G) but DDLJ will always be recognized as their best to date. Debutant director Aditya Chopra so perfectly brings these two together at the back-drop of a realistic family setting that its hard not to fall in love with them. Its chemistry at its finest. For Srk it was his first ""Raj"" character(play-girl type guy with the right values and morals) which he plays to perfection. For Kajol, DDLJ was a career making movie. As Simran she's beautiful, sweet, sensitive and a bit stuck-up too. Thank god Madhuri didn't have the dates to work in DDLJ cuz no actress suits Srk better then Kajol. There are countless heart-warming scenes between em' in DDLJ. Each one of them is uniquely different and just as much fun to watch. The entire setting of DDLJ is very simplistic, which brings out that special ""oomph"" in their romance. The songs are first-class. The strong supporting cast of Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal, Anupam Kher and Satish Shah definitely helped the movie to become the classic as its now seen as.Bottomline: DDLJ is 'romantic comedy' with Indian emotions at its peak. From the cast, chemistry, music, direction and the awesome pairing of Srk-Kajol....its perfect!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"DDLJ has been my all time favourite movie. its a wonderful love story about the second generation Asian youths! Raj the main character played by Shahrukh khan gives a superb performance and equally good as Simran (co-star) played by Kajol!! Its about a girl living in London, who's marriage has been arranged by her father to marry his best friend's son. She accepts her fate until she meets Raj in Europe and falls in love. The movie has won many awards including National Award(in India)for best story. The songs in the movie are also worth listening to, composed by Jatin Lalit which are melodious and romantic. Overall the movie is definitely 10/10, no doubt!!!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,If you missed this movie than you have missed the best movie made in bollywood history.This movie never seems to bore you.I have saw over a hundred times(Really).It's a fascinating movie.The plot was wonderful.The acting was really award winning.Shahrukh Khan is a gem of an actor.Really incredible acting by him.Kajol was excellent.The songs were awesome!The music was wow.The direction was cool.A must see for those who adore romantic flicks.,5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I recently took a class about India in college and towards the end of the semester, we watched a few clips from some Bollywood and Tamil movies. I was very moved and inspired by the clips alone! Then, I told my friend (who happens to be Indian) from my work study job invited to an ""Indian Movie Night"" at her dorm. We watched K3G and I was so touched by it! It was simply wonderful. Most of all, I became a SRK and Kajol fan. Their on-screen chemistry is remarkable! I can't explain it! Anyhoo, I asked my mom for some Bollywood movies for Christmas and one of the movies I got was DDLJ. And let me tell ya'll, it is now my favorite movie of all time. SRK and Kajol shine beyond reason in this flick. The script is excellent, everything is excellent especially the acting and memorable songs! The supporting cast (most notably Simran parents, sister and Raj's dad were figging awesome!) Mr. Amish (sic) Puri, who played Kajol's dad acts wonderfully with just his eyes! One of the funniest lines in the movie is when Raj's friend walks into Simran's dad store and says ""Uncle, can I have some beer?!"" Gosh, it's the way that cat said the line that made it so FUNNY! After watching it again yesterday, I realized that I love so many Hollywood movies (particularly classic ones) and yet I couldn't state my all time favorite one. But while watching the making of DDLJ (I own the special edition version with two DVD's inside), I became rather teary eyed. I mean, I'm getting teary eyed writing this review at this moment! This film touched not only my heart, but my soul as well. They are so many underlying messages in DDLJ that can strike a cord in a non-Indian's (like me, I'm Nigerian American) soul. In end, I hope people who read this will buy DDLJ, (Renting will be useless, because you'll want to watch it over and over again...) love this priceless gem of a movie, and this goes out to the girls, wanna ""come...fall in love"" with a cool, crazy, sexy guy like Raj!PS- THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Probably one of the greatest love stories ever told. Director Aditya Chopra made his debut as a director with this film. Aditya is the son of legendary Director/Producer Yash Chopra who gave us films like Deewar, Darr, Waqt, Kabhie Kabhie, Dil To Pagal Hai and Veer-Zaara.Aditya was one the first Directors of the New Generation of the Indian film Directors. With his first film he got rave reviews and was immediately classified as one of the best directors in Indian Cinema. With DDLJ, Aditya showed us what falling in love, respect, and family values are all about. This film also confirmed the Pair of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol as one of the best in the Indian Cinema. It made Kajol and Shah Rukh superstars over night and two of the most sought after actors.DDLJ also started the trend of love stories in Indian Cinema. Before DDLJ, most Indian films were action films. But DDLJ changed all that and the way of war was changed to a way of love. It's incredible how this film changed the Indian Cinema and the way of making films. DDLJ is a Forever Classic.It recently set a new record for the longest running film when it crossed the 500th week mark (that means it's a 10 time golden jubilee), the previous record was 275 weeks and was held by SHOLAY (another forever classic). All I can say is you must watch this movie, because ""After Raj met Simran, love wasn't the same...come fall in love all over again"".",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"This was the top Bollywood film of the 90s and after seeing it I really can't think of one that was better. There are some that are just as good but I can't recall seeing one that's better. The story's pretty routine: boy meets girl in Europe, they fall in love, girl is engaged to some other idiot, and the rest writes itself... Sound familiar? Well it wasn't back in '95 (or even if it was it wasn't done as well) and Aditya Chopra's treatment of the story was a big reason for it's success. In every other movie the couple first wants to kill each other before falling in love. But in this movie it's slightly different and more plausible. Shahrukh doesn't want to kill Kahol - I mean Kajol - and she doesn't really hate him either, she just (like the rest of us) is annoyed by the guy. Their situations aren't that far-fetched and their Europe storyline is played out quite realistically (of course the piano scene is an exception). This was the beginning of the ""Shahrukh plays Shahrukh era"" and, for what it's worth, he hasn't made a better movie or given a better performance since. Sure there are places where he overacts but there are just as many places where he's able to hit all his cues. His comic timing was never better and there was still some sincerity in his eyes, a reminder of the fact that he was still an actor, which has since been replaced by the cockiness of a megastar. This is the movie that shot him to superstardom and put him alongside Aamir and Salman. Kajol is just as good (if not better), and I think after their next movie they'll win the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. The supporting cast is fine although no one really stands out. There are many moments in the film, most notably in the script, where you might feel a sense of deja vu. But keep in mind that this was the original, it's everything else that's a rehash. Bollywood headed straight for the sewer after this movie with almost all films, many of them starring Shahrukh, copying the same formula. Even at its 3 hour length the movie never drags till after the two-hour mark. I also want to comment on the film's Art Direction because it warrants a mention. Whether it's in Europe, England, or India, the movie has a very natural look to it. Unlike today's big films like Dil To Pagal Hai, or K3G, this movie looks good without trying to look good and I think that's a quality that's been lost on today's films. Too much attention is spent on the look at the expense of the story (if there is one!). The soundtrack of course is a classic, truly one of the all-time bests, with almost every song being a hit. The film won an unprecedented number of awards while breaking many records. There was a feeling that Aditya would follow in his father Yash's footsteps but regrettably the pressure got to him. He followed this up with the dreadful Mohabbatein which was slammed by audiences and critics alike. But so what. His first film was good, and with the current state of Bollywood movies - Devdas anyone? - you really can't get better than this.",0
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I usually go for Bollywood films for the music-dance numbers. While this flick has a few good ones, I was mostly pleased with the plot. I liked the second half the best. I was very disappointed to learn from IMDb that this is the second of only two films done by Pooja Rupanel. She brought a lot of life and spark to a minor role - the female lead's younger sister. She should have done more films. Like any really good comedy, the story had its serious aspects - just enough to make the plot interesting. The stand=by Bollywood love triangle plot can be used as many times as one wishes as long as one has good actors, terrific musical numbers, and a few novel plot twists.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a superb example of the genius of Hindi commercial cinema. If you see it, you'll get that it's not very different as a love story. It is even ordinary. But it becomes special for many reasons. First and foremost, for its fresh, naive spirit. Secondly, the many paradoxes it contains: it is powerful yet subtle, larger-than-life yet simple, funny yet sad, magical yet realistic, and so on. Thirdly, it is one of the first films portraying Indians who live outside their country (in this case, London). It also shows the yearning of the first-generation NRIs who live far away from their homeland and for many reasons find it difficult to come back. Yet, the film remains mainly a poignant, melancholic romance. Raj and Simran, the characters played by Shahrukh Khan and Kajol represent the last generation of youngsters who were innocent and naive. They were much more simple, respectful and full of life. Such people almost no longer exist nowadays. The film relates their love story in a rather mesmerising way. Every scene is important. There are many great moments in the film. Raj and Simran's entire acquaintance and interaction in the first half is charming. Their separation at the end of the first half, when both make each other understand of their true feelings without explicitly admitting it, is moving. The traditional wedding preparations in the second half are well-made; the values they show, Raj's attempts to conquer Simran's father, and the couple's deepening relationship are interesting. The only thing I regretted was the typical fight scene towards the end.Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, who undoubtedly form a great film couple, are both excellent in their roles. They act from the heart, and ably bring their characters to life. Shahrukh Khan is incredible as Raj, a modern guy who understands the value of family and marriage, and yet he has the look of a careless fool who does not take anything seriously. Khan acts with great ease, wit and humour, and his inner fear of losing his beloved is always understood. Kajol as the dreamy and poetic yet intransigent and smart Simran is exceptional, and she looks very hot throughout. Amrish Puri and Farida Jalal as Simran's parents provide great support. Amrish Puri is particularly impressive as the strict but soft-hearted father, and Jalal is touching as the woman who has lived life according to terms and does not want the same to happen to her daughter. Anupam Kher is funny and entertaining as Raj's father. The film's soundtrack is outstanding and is clearly one of the main reasons this film works so well and is unforgettable today. The music is very well identified with the film and its story. Just try to imagine you would be given to watch the movie with the songs edited out. You wouldn't want to, right? That's because every song is a gem and is as important as every other scene. Every song comes in the right place and is sung and pictured exceptionally well. The one closest to my heart is ""Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko"", for its beautiful melody and very melancholic feel, which is aided by its blend of fantasy and reality on-screen. It is performed to perfection by Lata Mangeshkar and Udit Narayan. DDLJ is a film that should not be missed by anyone. It is one of the great gifts of Yash Chopra and his banner. It is a milestone of Indian cinema for its ability to inject fresh and magical energies into a banal love story, and for making it classically memorable.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I'm sooo in love with this movie. Its way better than Kuch Kuch Hota Hai or any other Hindi film or ANY film in general that I've ever seen! It's that good! I just want to recommend this to everyone ESPECIALLY if your a Shah Ruhk Khan/Kajol fan, they are awesome together. The whole supporting cast does a great job too-  Put together with the beautiful direction of Aditya Chopra they turn a simple storyline of uncliched love into a heartfelt movie you can watch over and over again. Oh, and did I mention the songs rock too!",0
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Going to the theatre to watch this movie was supposed to be my 'punishment' (for doing what, I can't remember), but let me tell you, this was the best punishment of my life.This movie was fantastic! I found it groundbreaking in that it solidly addressed the doublestandards and idiocy that tend to pervade in the minds of a lot of Indian parents. It was definitely an anti-arranged marriage film, which was a plus.I still watch this movie from time to time, and I have to tell you I thoroughly enjoy it, every time. The songs are great, the actors are great, and the dialogue is pleasing.A timeless classic, that will probably never be repeated.10/10",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"This movie is one of my alltime favourites! The plot although not new is perfect, which is probably why it has been used so many times. Raj and Simran fall in love while touring through Europe and when they get home, Simran is supposed to be married off to India. What I love so much about Bollywood, is all in here. First of all, Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are the perfect couple. They interact so well, everything fits. Second, The music is so great, I played the DVD a week or so until I got the CD. Third, we first see the cultural environment of London and Europe, which is contrasted very nice against India with all the fantastic colourful clothing. Fourth nice story components and Dialugues. The only reason for me not to give full 10 stars, is because off the dreadful late 80ies clothes (obviously the 80ties in India lastet deep into the nineties and because I want to spare a star for Khabi Khushi Khabi Gham, which is in my opinion still the best Hindi movie ever.",4
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I'm not going to get too much into reviewing the story of this movie, most of the other reviews are covering that for you. Honestly I don't remember too much the story that well anyways beyond the basics. Besides this is a Bollywood film, you know the melodramatic story of a boy and girl who fall in love against their parents wishes. I'll stick to a more cultural commentary. I remember 1995's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge being a good movie that dealt with second generation Indians living in England. This was a funny film that struck a chord with younger Indians living in Western countries around the world, and it was an obvious smash hit in India as well. Let me say that every country in the world has something ""cool"" or ""bad ass"" about it. But India has often had the most uncool, nerdy stereotypes about it. When I was growing up in the 80s and 90s, most of the representation of Indians in Western culture was limited to Apu from The Simpsons. Taxi drivers, convenience store clerks, curry, cow worshipers, more curry, thick English accents, effeminate men and hairy women,... nothing here was ever cool (these stereotypes are still here, yet are finally changing, albeit slowly). What kind of crazy kid wanted to be Indian? If I could have gotten away with passing myself off as a Mexican, I probably would have tried it. But then there was Bollywood, showcasing the beautiful people of India that could dance and sing just as good as anyone on MTV. This was the cool side to India. It made India look beautiful, exotic, young, hip and cultured. One of the biggest audiences for Bollywood flicks outside of India had traditionally been Indian girls. Older audiences obviously watched too, but young Indian women growing up in America have always been keen to Bollywood, many years before the arrival of DDLJ. Bollywood models, gharba dances, since as long as I can remember Indian girls immediately zeroed in on knowing that Bollywood was a cool piece of Indian pop culture that non-Indians didn't have access too or couldn't immediately claim as ""theirs"". Instead of being impenetrably ""foreign"", this industry made India look much more ""exotic"". I suppose it's the better balance to all those National Geographic specials that showed nomads in India eating the most disgusting things imaginable. Like all Indian movies, Bollywood flicks are overacted with dumb plots and idiotic fight scenes, but it involves outrageously beautiful people dancing and singing and that's always going to be cool. Beautiful people can make almost anything look cool. If Apu from The Simpsons has an arranged marriage then from the Western point of view it may look backward, cruel and dorky. If Aishwarya Rai or Hrithik Roshan has an arranged marriage, then it seems much more exotic and cultured,...hey maybe there's something to the concept. Beautiful or well accomplished people can turn previously weirdo things about a country into something cooler then it used to be perceived as. People are damn superficial aren't they? (Bollywood stars all being so fair skinned is a topic for another time) But DDLJ had a cross over appeal that didn't just include Indian girls. It was the first film that I remember being ""big"" amongst Indians. When I say it was ""mainstream"" I don't really mean that it fully crossed over into non-Indian audiences (though I know it did), but rather this is was the first Bollywood movie that I remember that was widely talked about and had immense appeal among many different types of Indian American audiences. Before the release of this film, Bollywood movies seemed to exist in their own little niche of loyal cult followers (usually young Indian women). Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge broke some of the rules and didn't just appeal to Indian girls who wished they could be in a Bollywood movie and marry some hunky fair skinned North Indian guy. No this film had an exposure to a broader audience that seemed to really put Bollywood on the map for Indians that grew up outside of India. Indian guys were into this film, yeah probably because Indian girls were into it, but it was big change from what was going on before. A movie about second generation Indians was automatically going to appeal to every Indian growing up in Europe, Canada, Australia and of course the U.S. This was newer territory and since then Bollywood films have increasingly become more youth targeted in their marketing campaigns. Despite plenty of moments of stupidity (I remember a ridiculous ""Yeeeeeeaahhhhhhhh!!"" yell by Raj during a game of rugby), this movie was the beginning of a small change in Indian culture. Indian exposure to non-Indians and the dispelling of stereotypes is still very much a work in progress and people are unlikely to mention DDLJ on history papers in the future, but it had a milestone effect in my opinion within the community. The overtly glitzy Hrithik Roshan stuff today in 2006 seems a bit more aimed at pre-teen girls (so it's gone even younger), but DDLJ was the most talked about film in the 90s. 11 years have gone by, Shahrukh Khan is nearly 41 years old, he's basically an ""Uncle"" today, a status a lot of Gen-X Indian Americans are creeping towards. Of course Bollywood is a silly representation of India, it's like someone in Mumbai watching Rambo and thinking that's America. But for a brief moment in the mid 90s, people were united in talking about this Hindi movie, regardless if they spoke Hindi, Tamil or Malayalam. The movie had a great cast and awesome dance numbers, along with a more humorous angle then previous flicks I had seen. Recommended.",0
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"If you are reading this review to see if the film is worth seeing, where have you been hiding for the last few years?This film is brought from the stables of Yash Chopra. As you may have guessed it is a 3 way story. Raj (Shahrukh Khan) is a modern Indian guy living in London with his father, played by Anupam Kher. He decides to go on a Eurorail holiday with a couple of his friends and easily gets his rich father's approval. Simran (Kajol) also lives in London but is of much more traditional upbringing, in part due to her strict father (Amrish Puri). Her father starts to reckon that it is time for her to get married. She has no option but to agree. However, she asks her father for the chance to see Europe once with her friends and Amrish Puri is not keen on this at all. Much persuasion follows and reluctantly he agrees.As luck would have it, Raj and Simran and both of their sets of friends end up on the same train and visiting the same places in Europe. At first she detests him. However, she eventually becomes stranded in a remote part of Switzerland with him. All their friends are in the next location. Time passes, songs are sung and lo and behold the two begin to fall in love.The first part of the film ends as the two characters are back in London with their respective families. Amrish Puri overhears Simran talking about the events of the holiday and hits the roof. He packs the bags and takes his family back to the small village in Punjab where they come from. Raj is spurred on by Anupam Kher who says if something is worth having, he must chase after it.The second part of the film consists of Raj trying to win the trust and confidence of Simran's Punjabi family. It consists of several excellent comedy and song scenes. I will leave you to guess what happens in the end.This film does not really warrant superlatives. It is better than excellent. It is as near perfect as we are likely to ever see. Like I say, if you have not seen this film, where have you been? The soundtrack is classic. Everyone knows the words to ""Tujhe dekha to yeh jaana sanam"" and ""Mehndi laga ke rakhna.""The performance of the actors is first class. This really is the film that took Shahrukh to superstardom. Kajol also gives an incredible performance. This is the role that really made her name and deservedly so. Anupam Kher does a top comedy role and all the other actors have put in a magnificent performance.This really is a ""feel-good"" movie. If you have not seen it yet, make it your next priority to see the film. If you have, watch it again! This film, along with Hum Aapke Hain Kaun and more recently Kuch Kuch Hota Hai are the quintessential 1990's definition of excellent Hindi cinema. Take your family, as refreshingly, there is no sex, bad language or violence in any of the three films.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I just loved this film. I have seen it many times but still it's very entertaining, and a great family film to watch. Great story and brilliant actors in it. I just love Shah Rukh Khan and he is the best in this film along with other as well. Kajol is looking great and performance is the best too. If you have missed out this film then that means you have not watched a film that you can never forget. Come fall in love with it all over again. By seeing this movie you can feel like that you also want to love Raj or Simran too. Movie just brilliant movie. I can't express so much words but I think its just the best romantic movie ever made in film history. It had won the largest amount of awards that any other film has got. Shah Rukh as best actor, Kajol as best actress. Adi as best director, Best Film of the year, best play back singer Udit. Best supporting male and supporting female. And so many other awards as well. I just say that don't miss this flick. I give it a 1000/1000.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Dilwale dulhania Le jayenge is one of the bestest film in the world! Shah rukh khan is one of the main factor of the films great success, i absolutely loved it. It was hilarious and felt heart warming! I think everyone in the film did a great job. It made Shah rukh Khan rise to more fame as well as Kajol, because people wanted to see them act together more because of the chemistry between them. this movie and Devdas is a great credit to shahrukh khan, because you can see how Shah rukh khan has matured through acting. the best part of the film, is the fact that you see in other films where the lovers both want to runaway because the parents wont let them be together, whereas this film suggests that running away doesn't solve the problem. the other factor makes the film better is the fact that shahrukh khan himself went through the similar situation in 1994.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"This film is for anyone who has forgotten the meaning of life. It clearly demonstrates the power of love and its ability to move heaven and earth. This is much more than a movie. It is a gift for those whose hearts have been hurt, abused and misused. It is one of those rare occurrences where you can witness the real heart of Mother India in all her unobstructed glory. ""Shahrukh Kahn"", who plays Raj, is not merely an actor. He is the incarnation of one of those great Indian souls or teachers who is the embodiment of love. It is an incomparable privilege here to see him in his element. ""Amrish Puri"" is the quintessential Indian patriarch who is immovable in his dignity and beliefs. Beliefs that for him mean no less than the continuation of his Hindu ancestry. ""Kajol"", who plays Simran, is a true Indian princess. She will not disobey her father but she cannot ignore her heart or her love with Raj. I cannot praise ""Aditya Chopra"" enough for bringing this masterpiece to life. The direction is romantic, sweeping you up with every scene. You do not feel you are watching a film as much as experiencing a whirlwind. I must also mention that the music is true joy and inspiration and is essential to the whole package. The title song is magnificent. Thank you ""Jatin-Lalit."" This film will make you feel like you have not felt in a long time. See this movie and live again.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I am writing this review after watching the movie more than 5 times. The movie have very fine music, great presentation , very romantic story and so nice on screen chemistry between Shahruk and Kajole. Its a movie after which one want to fall in love. I think for Indian audiences the name of the movie is enough. I don't remember any movie in this genre to commensurate with this one. This movie comes out to be all time hit. So if you are feeling like to watch some musical drama, go for it again and again. One can also watch maine pyar kiya, jab we met, socha na tha etc for similar entertainment. I liked the acting of Mandira too. The way she falls for shahruk. The way she sees her faster heartthrobs.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,this movie is related to Indian culture although its based on NRI's. in first half Shahrukh(Raj) falls in love with Simran(Kajol) and in second half he makes the successful attempt to take away Simran as his bride by doing all things right. he had a easier option of taking away Simran without consent of her family but he chose the difficult way of proving himself the right person for her. the music of the movie is splendid and story is perfect. i don't have any more comments for this movie as the fact proves itself its simply THE BIGGEST hit of Indian movie industry till date. if you are an Indian then only you can appreciate this however it will make sense to others also..,5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"It's like this: Dilwale is no Battleship Potemkin, as my Indian friend who hates Bollywood pointed out to me when I said I preferred to analyse DDLJ than BP for our Analyzing Film exam but, then again, Dilwale is not trying to be.The reason why the movie is great and one of the best I've seen is because it's silly and simple, yes, but also tremendous fun! The songs and dances are truly amazing and, unlike some people believe, the characterisation has depth. I should know because I had to discuss the different distinctive traits that make up all the characters in DDLJ in my exam and people would be surprised at just how layered and complex they are, if they took the time to pay attention (if you don't believe me, read the BFI book on the movie).Also, the picture has no pretentiousness: unlike Devdas, which was so melodramatic I'm surprised the whole cast didn't die from the agony of having to act in such an overrated and over the top Romeo and Juliet ripoff (people scream all the time especially Aishwarya Rai who is the most hysterical of them all), DDLJ succeeds exactly because it's happy just giving us a magical young love story, which we could all relate to anyway but which is made even better because of the 1st rate performances given by everyone involved.Kudos to Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol (my two favourite Bollywood actors), for creating such an intense, believable yet innocent and pure chemistry that made their love scenes just so sweet, beautiful and really heart-felt to watch.I'm not saying that just because we are capable of enjoying this movie, we aren't capable of enjoying something more intellectual and political like Battleship Potemkin.But it's nice to watch a movie once in a while that is not depressing nor always giving us extreme scenes of violence and sex with which Hollywood seems to be obsessed with.Nowadays movies just seem to feature people who think life is not worth living, are always suicidal and spend their time doing sex and drugs. Maybe these sort of characters should be pitied or something but, frankly, they're beginning to bore me. I've seen enough movies featuring these sort of personages to last me a lifetime. Give me a character who's happy with life and not afraid to have fun anytime!Much like the celebrated Singin' In The Rain, DDLJ is fun, leaves you feeling elated, has funny dialogue and you can feel the love that everybody involved felt about the production, which increases the quality of the picture!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"DDLY was one of my first Hindi movies I have seen, and from the beginning I was in love with it. It really touched me by its love, simplicity and warmth. After DDLY I have seen many Hindi movies (still loving them very much), but none of them were as well as DDLY, and I really think that the movie is Shahrukhs and Kajols best performances. Their best scene together is I think the scene after the song ""Zarasa Jhoom Loon Main"" when Kajol find herself in a bed wearing Shahrukhs shirt and with his cloth on the bed. Then she asks him what happened last night, and off course he makes a joke that something happened. But just then you see his magic when he tries to comfort Kajol by saying: ""I know what you think of me, you think I'm a wastrel. But I'm no scum, I'm a Hindustani, and I know what honor means for a Hindi woman, and I would never even imagine that doing with you in my dreams"" A great line, that clearly says how Shahrukh is.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"My ever favorite movie.Man i can watch this movie no matter what.I have the tendency to leave all my work just to see this movie.After watching this one i fell in love with Shahrukh.Even today he is just too sweet as a lover and well he is too sweet in any role.:-D..... Anyways where the movie is concerned there can't be anything so sweet and simple as the love shown between the two leads.When this movie completed 500 weeks i actually went and saw it all over again in the hall just to relive the charisma and magic of the movie and the feeling of the true love and romance that this movie generates and one on which i have grown up.The caption 'Come.....fall in love' seems to be made for this movie as as many times as u watch it you will fall in love again and again not just with the movie or shahrukh or the chemistry of the lead pair but also with the very emotion called LOVE!!!!!!!Now about the movie....well i won't be doing justice if i name anyone mind-blowing scene as all of them are just too good.But still one scene does no matter what remain my fave is the one towards the end of the Europe trip where Shahrukh and Kajol are standing on the bridge where he questions her what if you would have fallen in love with someone on this trip,say for example me,then also will you still go and get married.On this kajol just stares and him and when he just laughs and says i was joking.She just gives him an exasperated look and walks away.He just stands there and chants...Palat,Palat,willing her to turn around and look at him if she loves him.The moment she looks back at him as she is boarding the train he just jumps up with true unadulterated joy of a man truly in love.The thing that pulls at my heart string is the very innocence of the feelings portrayed by the two of them.Well i can keep raving about this movie all day so closing on the note that its a must watch for all those who are in love.believe in it or have ever loved anyone.You will find a part of your love story shown in some or the other scene of the movie......COME.......FALL IN LOVE!!!!!!!!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"The movie is truly wonderful, and one of the best Bollywood has ever produced. I am almost tempted to give it 10 out of 10. However, I would take a point out for not doing a great job on cinematography - but the movie is truly a superb from every other aspect, so felt bad taking a point off. The Switzerland alps look great as backdrops, however, a true cinematographer can create the magic in its absence too!Direction & script: superb! Kudos to Aditya Chopra on an awesome job. Many Hindi movies focus so much on lead characters, sometimes they forget the supporting cast. This movie shows the supporting cast are not just a prop for the story, they have characters too! You cannot ignore a single character - apart from major characters like the Father of bride (Amrish Puri), mother (Farida Jalal), even the characters of Kuljit & his father (Satish Shah) too are well taken care of! Very few movies (like Sholay) are so strong on giving importance to each and every characters.The movie truly deserves all the 11 awards it got! The movie is surely the best for the SRK & Kajol duo. It touches every sense beautifully, so you never feel tired of watching it over and over again.Music: It may not be the best Jatin Lalit has every produced, but it perfectly suits the movie. And of course all the songs have been very well choreographed, so the music video is imprinted on everyone's mind.This movie was a milestone in opening up Bollywood's business abroad! It's got all the elements that appeals to an NRI audience. Bollywood has never looked back after this movie got so many accolades all over the world.Thanks to Aditya Chopra for crafting such a gem, hard to believe its his debut movie!This is the best movie of 90's and surely enough, it will remain in top 10 Bollywood has ever produced!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"It was one of my first *new* Bollywood movies that I have seen and I loved it. After the brooding heroes of the 70's and 80's Raj Malhotra was like a fresh breeze. The music is quite good, the characters are believable (and I swear I lived door to door with Simran's babuji a couple of years ago ;-)) and the love story is just cute. A bit dated when watched after ten years, but that is to be expected.Love the movie, love the music, but first of all I love Simran and Raj - Kajol and SRK do a very good job and have cemented their standing as Jodi #1 with this movie as well as with the following KKHH and K3G. Good family entertainment - THUMBS UP!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Ever since its release, me and my family have seen this movie 50, 60, 70, well to be honest, I don't even remember how many times. This movie has some kind of magic in it nobody knows why, but every time the movie is played, nobody among us, can resist to watch it completely. I have watched a lot of Indian movies, you name it, but at the same time, I don't watch every movie and I don't like most of the movies. But this one, it looks as if every single clip was done to the perfection.I have seen in lots of TV shows, that people compare Karan and Aditya. But to me, after watching DDLJ, KKKG, KKHH, M (mohabbatein), KHNH, I don't think there is any comparison between the two. Aditya's both movies are truly professional, script is so powerful and direction is so well done and the tempo is created in such a way that its very hard to find a mistake. Where as in KKKG, KKHH, KHNH on a lot of situations the movie seems to run out of hand. Handling of characters is not perfect nor is the script.This movie is truly a classy master piece which are not made every other day. Thats why, truly and deservedly it ran consecutively on one cinema screen for more than 6 years. WAO !!!!!!!",0
Notebook,Great story line excellent location Zaheer Iqbal And Pranutan Bahl Loved the movie and the kids my God everyone of them amazing job,5
Notebook,"Finally, after a long time I found two debutants doing a fine job! The kids are adorable. They are the heart of the movie. Well written script and screenplay. I loved the dialogues as well, especially the humour involving the kids. The photograohy is top notch and does complete justice to our very own paradise on earth- Kashmir! I wasnt bored at any moment in the film and it left me wanting more of Zaheer and Pranutan. Nitin Kakkar, we want more movies from you. Thank you to Salman Khan for producing this one.

Notebook,"-------Kabir (Zaheer Iqbal) stumbles upon the notebook where Firdous (Pranutan Bahl) has penned her most intimate thoughts. He falls in love without ever having known or met her.You can find love in the most unexpected places and situations. That's what happens to Kabir when he takes up the job to teach at a remote house-boat school in Kashmir. He discovers a notebook that the previous teacher, Firdous used as her diary and he falls in love with her emotions and passions. Featuring a truly innovative concept, Notebook is a film for die-hard romantics. But the film doesn't really do enough with its basic premise. The one-line narrative is interesting, but the screenplay fails to do anything more.An adaptation of the Thai drama 'The Teacher's Diary' (2014), Notebook makes good use of the talents of its newcomers Zaheer Iqbal and Pranutan Bahl. The freshness of the lead pair and the exotic Kashmiri setting add visual appeal to the movie. The unusual story of falling in love with someone you've never met holds intrigue for most part of the run time, too. But the movie takes a little too much time to set things up.The young couple don't meet until the climactic portions of the film and once the high-drama kicks in it feels too little, too late.The highlights of 'Notebook' are the cinematography, mesmerising visuals of Kashmir are great.'Notebook' is an easy watch where you can appreciate the humour, drama and romance. But the film leaves you wanting for more. Perhaps with more creativity in writing, this young romantic saga could have achieved more.",3

Notebook,It's beautiful story line with great cinematography.....,4
Notebook,"I went to see this movie in theatre with the expectations of getting the visual treat of mountains and nature, and my expectations fulfilled. Debut actors were good, but the Story and it's Screenplay, and the Characters, along with the Direction, not to the mark. Characters are so dumb, so brainless, so illogical in this movie, Oh God. Movie could have been easily 15 minutes trimmed. Overall, for the visuals it's great, otherwise avoid it.",2
Notebook,So mesmerizing ... beautiful love story... Ending could've better though.must watch. I don't care if it's remake as long as it is so beautiful as it is..the direction is upto the mark.,5
Notebook,"Debut actor and actress, done their job perfectly.",5

everything just worst",1
Notebook,"Direction: Filmistaan fame Nitin Kakkar tried Thai remake with Kashmiri Tadka. However he failed to delivered any thing concrete. Neither it consider as great romantic movie or class in therm of execution.
Performance: Both leading actor- actress is making debut by this movie but chemistry was missing between them. Mir Sarwar looked good in negative role. Rest other star cast did not contributed much in terms of performance.
Script: This is adaptation of Thai movie Teacher's diary which associate lead pair with one notebook. Writers Shabbir Hashmi and Payal Asha took many creative liberties e.g. Notebook submerged into the water but content remained intact.
Music: Vishal Mishra's music was good for audience especially Mohit Chauhan's Safar and Vishal's Nai Lagda.
Cinematography: This is only section which impress the audience. Some virgin location from Kashmir will make you fall in love with those one.
Box-office: It opened with lower figure than expected one as it has earned only 75 lakhs on day 1. It can earn more than 1 crores on Saturday and Sunday but it will be flop at box-office as there is lack of good word of mouth.
Last Words: If you have already watched Kesari, Dumbo and Junglee, go for it otherwise enjoy the IPL.",2
Notebook,"I don't have any words.
All SKF production is doing now is to copy or remake the Korean movies.Notebook story is an identical twin of Thailandish movie Teacher's Diary.Now,people who have seen Teacher's Diary won't like the Hindi version.Same will be the story of Bharat which is copy or on similar lines of the Korean movie Ode to my Father.Salman Khan is my Fav but he shud bring something new and shud stop remaking and copying movies",2

God Of Gods,Season 2 is so horrible and slow. Just seem to drag every episode out.,0
God Of Gods,"First off, the show is very well made visually. As for plots - when it follows Gaiman's work, it's great. When it veers off on its own it becomes horrid. The writers are really, really untalented. Their dialogue is nothing but quips and pseudo intellectualism and it stands out compared to book dialogue like a sore thumb. Their original story lines are trash.That's not what I wanted to write about, though. I was compelled to write the review because I gave up on the show after the constant politicizing became too much for me. And it's all intentional inserts on the part of the writers, because none of those scenes (listed below) are in the book.American Gods is one of my favorite books. One of the reasons why is because it's apolitical. Or at least it ignores hot topic issues. Here is a list of things that don't exist in the books but were inserted into the show:1)Black man being lynched. Including constant remarks from characters about the lynching. 2)Ignorant racist Czernobog 3)Anansi wearing 20th century clothing going on a civil rights rant in front of slaves on a slave boat. 4)Illigal immigrants' plight being lionized 5)Made up story of evil rednecks massacring illegals at the border 6)Illegals are the truly virtuous ones who carry Jesus with them. Jesus is in this, yes. 7)Evil white Christian rednecks shooting Jesus. So ironic! 8)Evil white American town that doesn't care about human life. 9)The true American spirit is evil and literally Nazi. I'm not misusing the word literally here by the way. 10)Stupid sexist leprechaun gets put in place by strong woman.If you can stomach this kind of blatant, hamfisted condescending garbage from the smug writers, I guess you can give the show a try. It's certainly well made and acted, but the writers are terrible and I'm certain the quality will keep going down as they diverge more and more from the book and ignore Gaiman's writing in favor of their own.Thanks for reading, if you did.",3
God Of Gods,"The first season was amazing, but this new season has lost its vibe, the coming to America intros are gone, the story seems to be stretched out, I'm guessing they want to run a few more seasons until the end of the story. I believe the reason they fired the old directors is the wanted to finish the story in season two with amazing story lines and visuals. a lot of people are not happy with this, waiting for two years for a dragged on story line with nothing of interest. the ratings will drop and it will get canceled before it can even finish its story. what a shame. the first season was promising.",1
God Of Gods,"Well, I picked up the book a few weeks back, before the show premiered. I'm a little ahead but I tell you, the show does a great job adapting this wonderful fantasy by Mr. Gaiman, verbatim at least for the pilot. The pace is great and the contemporary take on mythical figures is perfect. Great for people who enjoy mythology - if you know a bit about it beforehand it's going to improve the ride but not essential. Great if you enjoy fantasy. Amazing show. Watch it, it's worth it.Only downside is - I think it should air on Wednesdays, not Sundays!",5
God Of Gods,"I was excited about ""American Gods"", because I'm a fan of Neil Gaiman and that book. I really wanted to like the TV series, but after six episodes, I have to stop being in denial. It sucks. It's got a good cast, particularly Ian McShane playing the god Odin. The cinematography is slick and creative.The problem is that the Hollywood producers and screenwriters think they can make a better story than Gaiman. About half the content of the show are entirely new stories and characters they've made up, and none of them hit the mark. Even worse, they appear to be vehicles for the writers to preach politics. This is particularly evident in episode 6, which is likely where some folks will stop watching the series. Scene 1: Jesus Christ (none of this is in the book) is an illegal immigrant who walks across the Rio Grande --yeah he can walk on water that's one of his superpowers -- and when he gets to the other side a bunch of American border vigilantes wearing crosses shoot him. Bullets pierce his hands and feet and he dies laying in crucified stance on the beach. This is indulgent bad art.Scene 2: The god Vulcan (also this is not in the book) has a gun making factory. The town is filled with people wearing Nazi-like uniforms, carrying guns, grimacing meanly at the camera...there's a lot of grimacing here. Oh and they lunch black people.Not only are these bad heavy handed scenes that violate the style of Gaiman's work, they are all intended to portray a straw-man model of how Hollywood sees conservative middle Americans: gun carrying, racist, immigrant-baby-killing, Christians. Nothing ruins good fiction faster than the injection of partisan politics.",1
God Of Gods,"The Good: A stunning title sequence, sublime aesthetic, and powerful themes.The Bad: The show is riddled with terrible dialogue, boring sub-plots, and an overdependence on (cringeworthy) CGI & post-production, all of which make for a tedious viewing experience. Another problem is the genre - magical realism - if (literally) anything can happen in the show without any explanation, there isn't a single reason left to care about the show or its characters.My biggest takeaway from this show is that magical realism is a risky genre for television and should not be taken up unless the showrunners know EXACTLY what the fuck they're doing. (Given that the showrunners have left the show, I reckon that to not be the case.)",3
God Of Gods,"With books it is almost always the same, you have either a too literal adaptation, that simply does not work in the movie medium or you have a version that is so very butchered, that it hardly resembles the original at all. With this, you have the rare exception.Even though the visuals are sometimes very gruesome, it perfectly fits the tone and story of the book and gave me almost the exact feeling that I had, when I read it. The actors are chosen well and especially the two main actors so far, Ricky Whittle and Ian McShane are doing insanely good jobs.It might be confusing at first, but that is just the journey we are taking part in, when we follow Shadow Moon's story. It is confusing to him, so it is to us, he does not know what is going on, so neither do we. This is something several very negative reviewers of this should have realized: Even if you don't get what exactly is going on in the first episode of a show, it does not mean the show has to be bad. It is called suspense. The plot should not need to be spoon fed! Let the show carry you with it and learn what it is about the same way Shadow does and risk being surprised! Oh and on a special note, even though I do not know whether the review was done by a troll or not: No, the show is not another ""typical TV show about vikings, knights and a lot of killing"". If you think that, you failed basic comprehension.",5
God Of Gods,"Review of Season One: American Gods is a brand spanking new fantasy TV show based on a novel by British author Neil Gaiman. It's an eight-part series which depicts a running battle between the old gods and new in modern-day America; former HOLLYOAKS actor Ricky Whittle headlines alongside Ian McShane. Truth be told, it's a difficult show to love; more interesting than entertaining, and very slow in parts. The film has way too many scenes dominated by CGI used to depict otherworldly beings, but which add to the story in no particular way; they're just there as general backdrop. It also tries a bit too hard to shock with explicit sex and violence unrelated to the story. It's a pity, as there are hints of greatness here, and some moments are a lot of fun. Surprisingly, it's the episodes centred around Emily Browning's character that turn out to be the best, because they're story-centred rather than just aimless.",3
God Of Gods,"I loved this book. It's a rambling allegory of the cultures, hunger for power and the melting pot of everything that America is. There's pathos and humour, and a deep sense of the greater mysteries of life. Unfortunately, much of this was lost in the first episode. there's far too much, unnecessary gore a la Hannibal. That was fine for Hannibal, but distracts horribly from the underlying humanity of the book's story. The humour of the Techno Kid is completely lost in a departure from the book which ends instead - you guessed it - as a bloodfest lifted from Hannibal. What a turnoff. I would have said that in presenting this book, given the current craziness infesting American politics, it was actually pretty important to get it right, the effectiveness of TV in getting a message across should not be underestimated. So I feel this was a real let down. Another mess up was dragging out a totally gratuitous scene not in the book - Robbie's wife harassing Shadow over his dead wife's grave. It detracted from what could have been a poignant scene and I don't get why it was done this way. Yes, the American gods (who are actually from diverse cultures all over the world) and Odin himself are brutal, sexual creatures, much as the stories of them relate. But a little more subtlety, insight and recognising the strengths of the narrative, rather than the ego-driven need to 'improve' (which invariably fails to do so) was needed to make this complex book palatable on screen. Unfortunately it failed. Oh well. Fuller probably wasn't the producer for this.",2
God Of Gods,From the off they got the casting wrong. The Ken doll in the central role is unconvincing & more suited to a 90210 style show. Ian McShane is outstanding (as always) but has zero chemistry with the Ken doll lead.Amazon have compared this show to Game Of Thrones in the advertising which is a bloody liberty as it's incomparable due to Game Of Thrones having a strong & clear narrative that grips you & doesn't let go - everything that American Gods does not have.Over stylised production without narrative/story is a flaw far too many shows have. American Gods looks pretty but has no connectivity - just like the lead. There really is not much more to say about American Gods. Unoriginal sleight of hand with nothing of interest revealed.Story! Characters! Empathy! Connectivity! Where are these things?Ian McShane's talent is wasted here.,2
God Of Gods,"I loved the overall concept of this show, visually this show looks amazing. But unfortunately it suffers for a sever lack of interesting storyline. The main character is extremely unrelatable and you really don't care about him at all. It has lots of unnecessary over the top sex scenes and violent cut aways which so far have little to nothing to add to the overall storyline and seem to be shoehorned into the story to add shock value. The whole thing feels extremely disjointed and plots slowly. Because of the concept and visual appearance of the show I really want to like it. But its just so all over the place storywise, slow moving and generally boring. It seems to be that unless you've read the novels and know whats going to happen.. You will not enjoy this show. Hate to say it.. but don't waste your time.",1
God Of Gods,"I recall a review of Westworld where it was suggested that the entire medium of television had just entered a third cycle. The first was the 50s, the second was the 90s (major improvement in writing, imagination, use of technology) and the third is now. Where every possible mix of acting, dialog, SFX, etc. is now being used with just one single intention. To get inside the viewer's head, and make the viewer have a good time.I am pretty sure this is another example of TV 3.0, as are other recent shows like Legion (which I still do not understand, but love) and Outcast (which I sort of understand, and also love.) American Gods seems determined to take this to an entirely different level. Even if you are a die-hard fan of VIKINGS (guilty), the opening sequence here in episode 1 where the first Viking to set foot in America is literally ""arrowed to death"" is, well, unforgettable.I have no idea where this series is headed but, like the others mentioned, it is addictive and unpredictable. More, please. **** Addendum ***** Sept 2017 *******1. As I work my my way through S01 waiting patiently for S02 (Thank you Starz for answering our ""prayers""), I still am not completely sure what I am watching but I am having a great time. There is a party in my brain. Everyone is invited.2. This is my favorite ""new"" (as in ""TV 3.0"") show since Banshee, which seemed at first to be just another modern western (like Justified) but, the more you got into it, the more you realized it was insane and crazy and unpredictable and great fun. Like this show.3. The casting is beyond brilliant. Ian McShane is not only an astonishing (and unappreciated) actor, but he has an empathy we can instantly relate to. If the world were to end tomorrow, and he was the one picked to give everyone the bad news, it would somehow seem more manageable. And Emily Browning, oh my, words fail me. If you were to take a moment to study the history of the Academy Awards (boring!) you would notice, the more physically challenging the role, the more likely the Academy was to honor it. Here, the ever-spunky Browning plays a dead wife who is determined to win back her husband even if she has to carry around a needle & thread in order to constantly sew herself back up. Unfortunately the Emmy people (who completely and unfairly snubbed Browning) seem to use a different playbook?4. There are bits of astonishing dialog in this show that are already being mentioned in IMDb lists. From Git Gone (S01E04), this just a sample: Anubis: ""Was it love?"" Laura: ""It wasn't. But I suppose it is now."" Anubis: ""That is unfortunate. Love will always have you at a disadvantage."" Laura: ""I think BEING DEAD has me at a disadvantage.""(Wow.)",5
God Of Gods,"Casting: As things stand, this is some of the best casting in a book-to-TV adaptation I have seen in recent memory. Each character is given their moment to shine and the cast brings it to a new level. Truly a relief considering this is one of Gaiman's most compelling works. Music: Spot on! Very fitting for the emotion and gravity felt in each scene. Story: Stays very close to the original book narrative, but gives some of the most fascinating characters a little more screen time.Tone: Surprisingly whimsical at times. It may seem jarring for folks unfamiliar with the original work on the storytelling style of the show runners. There's violence and sex in abundance, but beneath it all, there's an existential dread among the Old Gods. Overall: 10/10 Could not recommend this show any more highly!",5
God Of Gods,I love the book. That's where I come from.This series tries so hard to be better than its source material. It tries and it fails. Art is about emotions. Any good artist will avoid emotions. This is the paradox American Gods does not understand.Summary: Read the book.,3
God Of Gods,"There is much to enjoy about American Gods. It has the legacy of a near-classic novel from Neil Gaiman, a capable cast, a unique visual aesthetic, a passably good script, and Ian McShane. Some people have taken issue with the violence and sex. I have no issue with that at all. In fact, I would have welcomed more of it. What robbed the show of feeling timeless and intellectually sincere, however, was the near constant political messaging that saturated the experience with a relentlessness that seems somewhat malicious in hindsight. This is probably the most anti-conservative show I have ever seen, and all of its lofty artistic aspirations get left behind in its smug mission to caricaturize conservatives and their perceived viewpoints in wildly offensive and ridiculous ways. Liberals will find much to celebrate, here, but for everyone else who is trying to escape the hysterical politicization of nearly every facet of media, it might be better simply to read the book.It's a shame too, since there are real moments of brilliance when the writers remember to tell a universally poignant story instead of regurgitating leftist allegories.",3
God Of Gods,"I really don't know why screenplay writers seem to need to mess with a good thing. The book, ""American Gods,"" is a well-written tome where the author delves into mythology, modern drama, and the macabre. Think of it as Stephen King meets Herman Hesse, while delving into Japanese anime, then you have an idea of how the book goes. However, the TV series plays fast and loose with the main characters, as described in the book, as well as freely adding and subtracting from what the author wrote. What you end up with loosely follows the original story line, faithfully sticking to content in some places, not at all in others. The main character, Shadow, isn't black in the book. The slave ship episode isn't there either, and the flavor of the initial meeting with Mr. Wednesday loses its comedic value that the author originally included. I mean, Shadow does a good job of ditching Mr. Wednesday, only to have him materialize next to him at the urinal, asking if Shadow wants the job or not. Other story line elements, the black prostitute who turns out to be a god, is close, but no cigar here either. Hopefully the series will develop better as it goes along, because the first two episodes rate only a meh thus far. So much potential, and so little delivery.",2
God Of Gods,Season 2 is too slow and horrible. Still introducing character. Season 1 was way more treat to watch than 2.,3
God Of Gods,"I have read the book three times. I will keep this review short. The series is just as good. Czernobog, Bilquis, Shadow, Low Key, Mr Wednesday, Anansi, all of them are so close to how I pictured them to be in my mind that I see nothing wrong with the series. I only hope that the end of the series matches the book.",5
God Of Gods,"This show had the potential to be good, but in typical Hollywood style it interjects copious amounts of the social justice narrative into the show. White people are evil, particularly white men. Migrants are poor victims blacks are abused and oppressed, insert any of the current social justice agenda and you will see it present in spades in this show.I am guessing most the reviews were based on the first episode, these themes were minor in the first episode, but really got bigger and bigger throughout, till it became unwatchable. This stuff is killing Hollywood, personally I have canceled cable and not went to the movies in years now. until Hollywood stops shilling one point of view I will continue to boycott them and recommend everyone else do the same.",1
God Of Gods,"I read the book years ago, and I loved it. My wife is a fan of Gaiman, But this book is still in his ""to do"" list. I spent all the time answering questions about what we are watching. It is simply impossible to follow if you have not read the book.Of course Gaiman's universe is weird and personal, and you don't really realise where the story is taking you until maybe half or even three quarters of the book, but you can follow the underlying story. You can follow Shadow's ""adventures"" and how is slowly been involved with all Wednesday's world. But with this TV show, it is slightly more than few unconnected nonsense scenes. There is no story to tell, it is a collection of video clips. Nothing more.After five episodes (out of eight) of the first season I don't feel the need for wait for a second season. Not at all.",2
God Of Gods,"First off, the series is rather unconventional. You do not wanna expect typical mystery / scifi stuff, or you'll be disappointed, as so many are.The strength of Americans Gods is really strong acting, very interesting characters that get you hooked onto, and a carefully, intelligently developed story that unfolds around all of that.Like I said in the beginning, this series does not want to be action centered, it deals with mythical/philosophical questions and puts it into context to the real world. Yet this might seem weird to a few people, it is not exceeding the boundaries to become pure art-fiction. Though there are lots of artistic pictures and metaphors, it is always rooted to reality. At least if you have a bit of a sense for fantasy or a passion for philosophical questions.",4
God Of Gods,"I love the actors and setting and the entire premise of the gods. And Gillian Anderson - WOW. She is gorgeous and amazing as the two famous characters she has played so far. Captures the essence so well! Well, they all do! Love it, love it, love it! If you haven't caught it yet, you should. And you may want to sort by Love It since there is a little troll who must absolutely hate this show because he thumbs downs every positive new comment 22 times within minutes. Lol! How fun a life! :) ENJOY this show. It is wonderful and I can't say enough god (ooops, Freudian slip, but it stays) things about it.",5
God Of Gods,"A great series but as another reviewer said, it is not meant for slow people or people who want their car crashes and chases tube fed to them. You actually have to use your brain for this one (sorry). As yet another reviewer wanted to put it, but I'm not quite sure if they were just pulling our leg with the spelling, this is mostly for the intellectually savvy. It also helps if you like art.Like in all my reviews however, I urge you to watch it for yourself if you haven't yet. These days you have people living in less than optimum situations who don't get out much so they create accounts in order to be somehow relevant and try to sway public opinion. In the end though, only you know what you like and don't like and no one who isn't old enough to shave or have known the feel of a woman's caress can really sway your opinion no matter how much they try. Right?One last thing. I was going to give it a 10, but I agree that it is overhanded with its political agenda, so I decided on an 8. Seeing the number of fake negative down ratings on the positive reviews and imagining there are at least a few negative fake reviews to back those up, brought it back up to a 10.",5
God Of Gods,"I am so sad we're almost at the season finale. This program has been a a wonderful watch and something to look forward to during the week amidst some other good programs currently on and amidst some not so great ones. The premise is wonderful. The series itself is funny, sexy, weird, almost bizarre sometimes, in a good way.",5
God Of Gods,"I read the book about a year ago and needless to say i liked it. Hearing of this TV show really excited me but at the same time i had that apprehension of it falling short of expectations or deviating from the book. I must say the first episode dispelled all such apprehensions. The TV show remains fairly faithful to the book (as per my memory at least) and Ian McShane as Mr. Wednesday is near perfect. The visual effects are good and the episode was engrossing. I am really stoked about this one. Thinking of all the scenes that are coming. The only thing that i can complain about is that at times the choice for the musical score seemed off with the actual events of the scene. This is a minor issue though and very subjective. All in all, this is a must watch for both, people who have or haven't read the book. :)",5

Basically June is the typical dreamerthat finds out that life bites back and that's a good thing. If your going into watching this show now, its not going to be too easy due to his personality, but the more you watch it you will start to see how June actually handles trying to connect with people from her past and how he can stay relevant in todays media. With witty (and cutways too) jokes and pretty reasonable emotional moments, its a cartoon that makes you feel apart of the multiple situation he is in and always wonder whats going to happen next, its hooks you at a different physiological level that other animated see that as a good thing!",5
Wonder Park,"Saw this with my family and not only did my wife and I enjoy it but my 4 year old son loved it as well. He loved the park and the characters and I think some of the more serious and sad parts are a little over his head he still seemed to understand why she was sad. It was a tear jerker for my wife. The wonder of the movie really is the magic of childhood and the possibilities that come along with it.

Wonder Park,"Hehehe. Don't bring your ADULT brain into the theater! We LOVED it! This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie for Children, so just let your imagination soar. It has Wonderment, Great Graphics, a Great Soundtrack... And Interesting Characters. A lot of Adults are trying to put Adult Blinders on a Kid's Movie, then trying to Criticize it. That is NOT what is going on!The Imaginary Pretend Rides are for the Imagination. Some Grown-ups have lost theirs.Goto the 3D Version... To enjoy the Rides! We did and LOVED it! All Classic Kid Films have a bit of a Dark Theme, or they aren't any good. Bambi, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Cinderella come to mind. Completely throw out about your Kids being miserable or confused. They will look past it, because it has a nice endingAs I mentioned at the top... This is NOT for entertaining ADULTS, as much as it is the Kids, despite many Adults trying to READ Adult themes into it. That's NOT the Point! If you leave your Adult Brain outside the theater... You'll absolutely enjoy this ... I KNOW your Kids will... I have not heard one single complaint yet. And Grandparents that take the Grandkids absolutely Loved it too!

Wonder Park,"This movie was by far one of the best animated movies of the spring movie season. In reality, this was the splat's first ORIGINAL animated theatrical release since 2006 with Barnyard. By god, this movie was amazing and has a really cool story.
Sad thing is... No one was laughing in the theater except me! The jokes were fresh, Characters were moving along the tracks, and the animation was just freaking beautiful!
I would say that Nickelodeon has pulled a miracle out of its bag of tricks. This movie was so heartfelt, wonderful, and just overall a family-friendly movie that would really made families agree that this is probably the best work out of the splat's studio since Barnyard back in 200614 years in the making, it was worth every penny! I even stood and applauded as the credits roll cause it was just that good! Bring this to heart next time you criticize a movie like this... Its all about the imigination and the heart. And this movie does both!",5
Wonder Park,"The central character in Wonder Park is an 8-year-old girl who nearly destroys her neighborhood with a homemade roller coaster and whose mother is desperately ill. Did I mention that it's an animated film geared to kiddies? This Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Movies production seeks to deliver an inspirational message about the power of imagination. But like so many animated movies these days, it buries its ideas in a visual and aural cacophony of frenzied action sequences designed to engage the shortest of attention spans. It also features a gallery of would-be adorable animal characters so obviously designed to fly off toy store shelves that you expect the merchandise to be on sale in the theater lobby. As is also usual these days, an overqualified cast of well-known performers has been recruited to provide the voices, even though the young target audience is unlikely to care that the little girl's parents are played by Jennifer Garner and Matthew Broderick. The animal characters are given life by more distinctive voices including Kenan Thompson and Ken Jeong, although when you hear John Oliver as a British-accented porcupine, you almost expect the little critter to launch into a deep-dive monologue about net neutrality or immigration reform. The little girl, June, is voiced by Brianna Denski. (The young actress reportedly beat out 1,500 others for the role.) A whiz at math, June has created an imaginary theme park, dubbed Wonderland, populated by characters inspired by her stuffed animals. They include chimpanzee impresario Peanut (two-time Tony Award winner Norbert Leo Butz, infusing his exuberant performance with welcome theatricality); Boomer (Ken Hudson Campbell), a bear who welcomes visitors; Steve (Oliver), a porcupine in charge of park safety; Greta (Mila Kunis), the boar on whom Steve has a helpless crush; and Cooper (Jeong) and Gus (Thompson), the beavers who handle maintenance. After June's mom is forced to leave home to seek treatment (what is it with the apparent desire of animated film creators to traumatize their young audiences?), June bitterly burns the meticulous blueprints for Wonderland and reluctantly heads off to math camp. But she runs away almost immediately, and while wandering in the woods encounters a real-life version of her imaginary theme park. But all is not well in Wonderland, and it's not only because the park's name was presumably too evocative of Alice in Wonderland to provide the film's title (you'd think someone would have thought of that at some point during production). It seems that Peanut has gone missing and a mysterious darkness has descended on the park, which has also been invaded by a horde of ""chimpanzombies,"" who are about as appealing as they sound. June resolves to save the park, with predictable and increasingly tiresome mayhem-filled set pieces ensuing. Featuring unappealing, prosaic CGI animation, the pic is strictly geared toward very young, undiscriminating tastes despite the frequent inclusion of adult-targeted lines of dialogue such as the bear explaining, ""I started to make mushroom calzones"" and another creature lamenting his ""existential crisis.""",5
Wonder Park,"A sweet movie, far deeper and more entertaining than the previews suggest. Parents should know that they discuss parents getting sick. June, a wonderful girl full of imagination, discovers an incredible amusement park called Wonderland hidden in the woods, however the park is in disarray, due to the darkness. Can she and the animals fix everything? We loved this movie and the emphasis on the importance of imagination. Check out our family review and discussion questions on Down The Hobbit Hole Blog dot com.",4
Wonder Park,"A well written animated film, tries to make us remember the wonder of our imagination. And what it was like going to a popular amusement park, like Disney World and Six Flags.
I like the animation, although the story is fun, but nothing real special. I do like the characters, they really come alive. Scenes of the Wonder Park are amazingly well drawn. Actors doing the voices are good too. This is a good film to take your family to see, but it's a film you could only see one time, that is my opinion, but a kid could enjoy this many times more.",4
Wonder Park,"Wonder Park, written by Josh Applebaum and Andre Nemec, is a touching film and a magical adventure. It is filled with action, humor and heartfelt moments that make it enjoyable. The movie is all about the power of love and imagination. It is a wild ride of fun.The movie tells the story of a young girl, June Bailey, (Sofia Mali and Brianna Denski). She is very imaginative and adventurous, which shows throughout the movie. She and her mom (Jennifer Garner) have a very close relationship. Together they invent a theme park called Wonderland, based on figments from June's imagination. It is a whimsical place filled with exciting rides and attractions, such as a flying fish carousel and crazy roller coasters. The park has great characters like Boomer, the narcoleptic bear and Steve, a gentle porcupine. There is also Greta, a feisty hog and a beaver Cooper played by the hilarious Ken Jeong. My favorite character is the monkey Peanut (Norbert Leo Butz), the leader of the park. He is such an endearing character. When June's love for the park is tested, the magic of what she and her mom created begins to disappear. It's up to June to save the park and herself.The plot is creative. I like the animation and the magical looking effects. I love the vision of the park and the details that capture the theme of a child's mind. All of the areas of the park are vibrant and unique. I love the bendy straw slide and the balloon cove. The scenes match the mood of what occurs in the storyline. One of my favorite parts is when June first comes to Wonderland and sees that her creations are real.The movie has some emotional moments between June and her mother. We see how June goes from being a happy-go-lucky kid to a sad little girl. We watch her love for the park fade away. However, we see her get her shine back. It is a great story about relationships and the importance of imagination and always believing.I rate this film 4 out 5 stars and recommend it for ages 3 to 13, as well as the entire family.Reviewed by Jordan M., KIDS FIRST!

Wonder Park,"So first off this movie is just amazing. It had me laughing, crying and just filled with emotion and investment throughout the whole movie.You will notice an unfortunatly large amount of negative reviews about this movie and I have to say please moderate the ones you know have no thought in them.The ones I speak of are every single one that only says ""this movie is sad. My kid didn't like it. Not for under 6.""OF COURSE IT'S NOT!So for parents. Here's the thing, judge movies you wanna show your kids based on how you wanna raise them but please think before you simply just say something that has absolutely no actual thought behind it as it does impact the enjoyment older kids get from studios endeavors.This is the first non SpongeBob (ugh) nickelodeon movie in decades. An original ip that came out of nowhere. Think very carefully about that. The reason is because SpongeBob is known, ""safe"" even though it clearly isn't smart for the most part after its first half of seasons, and parents just don't want to think too hard about what their kids see.This. Is. A. Horrible way to watch movies for ANYONE! Not just kids. You can not care what you watch but kids need stimulating thought provoking innovative ideas that will carry them through the world they have to navigate and learn about. So being sad is an emotion of which kids feel and need to feel and discuss with you a parent in order to grow.So where does that leave this movie? Mixed honestly. Someone like me loved it for it's imagination, it's heart, the main character and her drive to invent, create and ultimately rediscover why it's important to do so after something that happens to bury those feelings.The mixed part comes into play when you as an older person who knows how to analyze movies and characters. The message of the movie can be confusing. This is purely a matter of perspective so I can only give mine and if someone disagrees then they are free too. Just don't say ""it's stupid cause it's sad and I don't wanna watch sad things with my kid's"". To which I say, here's a happy meal, your hamster ball and a wall with no paint. I'd let you watch the paint dry but we wouldn't wanna get too exciting or dare I say...... CREATIVE!The inventions in this movie are an absolute pleasure to see come to life. And I don't mean literally either even though that's also fun. I mean to see a child think of these wonderful ideas and be encouraged by their parents to think of even greater more fun ways to look at them even if the kid thinks you as the smarter parent could probably come up with something better. It's how it should be since the child is taught that their ideas matter and they are important to express in only words they can say.Overall without spoiling too much I will say you will enjoy this movie if you are looking for a character that is strong, creative and finds out why it's important to be that way.If you aren't then that's ok. There are plenty of fine movies you can watch. Just make sure that they have heart and don't always play it safe. A Disney movie can be scary and that's good. A nickelodeon movie can be sad and that's ok. A warner bros movie can have crazy amounts of creativity. All movies can have inappropriate humor if you py attention to what they sneak in. Nothing is meant to be sacred and nothing is truly safe. Take a chance, have fun and explore. Your heart will thank you for it.",5
Wonder Park,"I watched this movie with 2 daughters together. Movie show how about imagine world, about family love, about friendship. That's great.Why you vote it bad?",5
Wonder Park,"I love them parks and this movie brought it! 3D with the motion effects from D-Box made this movie a lot of fun! It made me smile a more than a few times. I'm a sucker for a theme park i must admit. Mix a theme park with animation where you can stretch physics and imagination makes me giddy. That part was pretty good. Could've used a couple more ride shots honestly. But the shots they did have were amazing! They did great POV shots and looking up and great angles all over. I was impressed with the direction and cinematography. The message was not as dark as a Disney film, but it was centered on a child's growth. Thankfully it wasn't solved with love or magic, but real problem solving. All the major characters were female with lots of supporting men.It was enjoyable and creative. I got what i expected.",4
Wonder Park,Very family friendly. No child-parent separation like Dumbo or testicle groping like Show Dogs. Not sure why all the bad reviews. I took my kids to see it twice in the theater.,4
Wonder Park,Okay so I purchased tickets for me and my little step cousin whose 3 we she loved the colors and the lights and funny moments however there was an extremely dark tone to the movie it was just very sad and hard not to cry I heard older kids crying the movie was cute just simply know your kids,4
Wonder Park,My 7 year old daughter loved it. I think the movie is underrated.,4
Wonder Park,"I don't even care what the reviews say, this is the best movie in my entire life! Can't wait for the show to air on Nickelodeon!",5

Wonder Park,"Definatly not a pixar with the depth of the story, but not bad if you got little kids around5-10. I went in expecting a bad movie after reading the critics. Spent 30 min trying to get my kids to see how to train my dragon. But it wasnt as bad as i thought.",4

Ramai,"Have you heard of Stay? If you're here you must have but I'll bet it wasn't too long ago that you found out about it. It's a movie that came out late last year with little fanfare, was dismissed as a poor movie by critics and quickly ushered back out of theaters.It's a crying shame.It was a wonderful movie. My favorite type of movies are psychological horror movies. Favorites include: Jacob's Ladder, Mulholland Dr., Donnie Darko, and in a similar realm, Momento and Fight Club. I love seeing a good representation of the human mind on film and that is exactly what this film shows so well.It's about a college student (Ryan Gosling) who tells his shrink (Ewan McGregor) that he is going to kill himself on the stroke of midnight this Saturday, leaving his shrink to enlist the help of his formerly suicidal girlfriend (Naomi Watts) to figure out why he wants to kill himself and how to stop him, while his world falls apart.It's directed by Marc Forster of Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland fame. The movie has been called pretentious, shallow, ridiculous, bewildering, absurd, and empty by many reviewers. Personally I think that they didn't have the patience for it and/or were put off by its extravagant visuals and cuts. I thought it was great and deserves much more credit than it has received.The movie's visual style is very interesting and jarring in a good way. It had me constantly saying to my girlfriend ""did you see that?"" Full of slight of the hand camera/editing tricks. Nearly everything in the movie is symbolic of other things or ideas in the movie. The acting is very good, especially among the lesser characters. Everything in the movie feels so unreal, but that is serves some purpose even if one couldn't know what it is right away. A second viewing would reveal many new things. In the end much of the movie is left up to interpretation and my girlfriend and I had a good conversation about our ideas on what things meant in the movie. After thinking about it for a day I'm pretty sure that I could explain everything in the movie, even what the hell is up with Ewan McGregor's pants, Why Gosling wanted to commit suicide and the twins and triplets.It was fun was figuring out what the rest of the movie meant after seeing its end, the solution. The movie is like a code and the end is the decryption key. It differs from other ""sixth sense"" type surprise ending movies because everything you would see in the movie before the end would not act as a clue to what it all means or what the ending is. It's more like decrypting a diary than a problem with a solution to it.Basically, any movie buff owes it to themselves to see this movie. I rented it but after seeing it I fully intend to purchase the DVD.",5
Ramai,"I think the very first movie I ever saw that absolutely required a second viewing was Angel Heart, back in 1987. The second viewing is necessary because after you know what you know from the initial viewing, you get to watch an entirely different film the second time around. Angel Heart was considered before its time when it was released, and since then, indeed there has been a spate of these kinds of films, some more successful than others.Stay is one of these 2-films-in-1 experiences, but this film, unfortunately, is not as successful (in my eyes) as, say, The Sixth Sense, Memento, The Machinist or even Angel Heart. Those films succeed brilliantly because they manage to evoke a chilling impact on the viewer by the end. Stay, on the other hand, left me more confused than anything, even though I understood what had happened: -=- SPOILER ALERT -=- The film takes place in the consciousness of Ryan Gosling's character, Henry, who is teetering between life and death after a terrible car accident which killed the other passengers in his vehicle (his mother, his father and his soon-to-be-fiance). This is a horrendous tragedy, what has happened to Henry: if you can imagine being near death but yet aware that your 3 closest loved ones have been killed in an accident that you inadvertently caused (his tire blew out) - this is a monumentally sad thing to have happen to you, but yet this sadness was not effectively conveyed at the end of the movie because I was instead confused about what had transpired and I had to think about it in depth afterwards to realize that Ewan McGregor's character Sam (who seemed to be the main character of the movie) was also part of Henry's semi-conscious hallucinatory state.There were just too many scenes in the film that Henry didn't appear in (although McGregor and the always-fantastic Naomi Watts are perfectly cast in their 'roles', as is Gosling). In retrospect, I think this is what caused the confusion and left me not feeling the impact that should have been felt at the realization of what had just transpired. -=- END OF SPOILER. -=-I don't like making comparisons, but The Sixth Sense, for instance, was hugely successful because it was written in such a way that it included the viewer in Bruce Willis' shocking realization at the end; it has the impact it does (even on repeat viewings!) because of the masterful way it's staged.What I'm saying is, while Stay is a noble and ambitious effort and still worthy (in my opinion) of a couple of viewings, it's not enough to have a movie that becomes a second movie once you've seen it - the movie has to stand on its own the FIRST time; the impact has to be there the first time or there's no genuine payoff for the viewer. I love a movie that haunts you afterwards and makes you think, that's the best kind of film, but there does have to be that impact the first time, that all-important creeping sense of realization that makes your eyes go wide and gives you goosebumps.",3
Ramai,"It's hard to comment on this film without including a spoiler, but I feel it is necessary to try because of all of the unwarranted bad reviews this film is receiving. If you go into it expecting to see a rendition of The 6th Sense, you might be disappointed. If you go into it expecting to see a logical plot with a chronological story behind it and an honest portrayal of developed characters, you will be disappointed and very confused.However, if you go see this film with an open mind and simply EXPERIENCE what it has to offer, you will be rewarded greatly at the end - assuming, of course, that you understand what you have just seen, at least to some degree. For the best experience, pay attention to the little details, but don't try to figure anything out until the end. See it with someone so that you can discuss it afterward. It's that good.This movie is visually appealing and artistically constructed - pleasing to both the eye AND to the mind.",5
Ramai,"There is such a debate about this movie, on side arguing that you can ""get it"" if you are intelligent enough and the other arguing there is nothing to ""get."" Why don't you all stop worrying about whether or not you get it or not. Movies are art, and art is open to different interpretations. There is no right or wrong, and to steal a quote that I loved, (I can't remember exactly ""Bad Art is even better because it documents human failure"") sorry that quote wasn't really necessary and didn't fit my point exactly but I was just dying to use it.Anyway my main interpretation of the movie is to show the intricacies of the human brain. A man went through a serious shock/trauma, going unconscious, allowing his subconscious to come out and play, the movie demonstrates the power of the subconscious, pulling out stored tidbits of information from the brain received by the human senses. The movie documents not the man's physical struggle to stay alive but his mental one. With his brain setting up a maze of obstacles to get past to regain consciousness/life. In this maze of his mind I think his actual self represents death or the coming of death, and he is in the form of the psychologist (mcgregor) trying to work his way through the maze to fight to stay alive. I think this is why we saw the movie makes such a point of showing us that they are the same person (in his mind) I think he has chosen mcgreggor as his self because in his subconscious he knows that in the real life mcgreggor is trying to save him. As for the powers, it is his mind of course he is able to control what is happening. Leaving one end untangled, the de ja vu with mcgregor and watts at the end. To go with the flow of this interpretation, that the movie is demonstrating the power of the human mind, perhaps subconsciously the mans dream was able to affect the other people involved, through psychic powers, I'm not sure on this, this is a tough cookie.Of course another interpretation of this movie could possibly be two parrelel worlds colliding through an event (car crash) I don't know for sure I can only make my own interpretations, and I like this movie because of the different ways it can be interpreted, unlike most Hollywood movies, which leave no room for the imagination. This is art, good art: 8/10",4
Ramai,"This is really a spectacular film. I know I'm going to have to see it at least once more, because there's so much stuff going on that it's impossible to give Stay the attention in deserves in one viewing.First and foremost, although I won't give away the plot here, I'll say that the movie (thankfully) does not rely on a surprise ending for the totality of its impact. In fact, if you're paying attention, you can pretty much figure out (mostly) what the situation is before you get too far into the movie. Unlike some of the worst examples of this genre (i.e. The Sixth Sense), Stay is not a film that ""hides the ball,"" but instead presents you with characters and a storyline, and asks you to draw your own conclusions.That said, there isn't an obvious solution to the movie. While you may be able to explain the film after viewing it (which is trickier that it will seem at first), you may realize that the real brilliance of this film is in the levels of its narrative. At its core, it is a basic psychological thriller. Simultaneously, and perhaps subconsciously, it also meditates on weighty issues of reality and identity- consider what the imperative ""Stay"" means to different characters at different points in the film, and it's almost like you're watching an entirely different movie than you originally thought.Finally, the visuals in this movie provide their own context and narrative regarding the fragile nature of human memory and perception. This is the best looking movie I've seen in a long time, and the fact that it's combined with such a great story and cast makes this a rare treat.If there is a weak link here, it's probably Gosling, who I think missed some opportunities to really dig in with his character and creep us out. Still his acting is better than that of most of Hollywood's garbage these days.Final verdict: if you want a smart and unsettling film that will spur a serious discussion, watch this. You won't be disappointed.",5
Ramai,"For the few people that saw this film, it seems that people either love it or hate it, but that's the case with a lot of films these days. I thought the film was brilliant just because of how well thought out it was and it keeps you guessing till the end. Some movie goers aren't patient enough for a film like that.A lot of the hits, at least in the states, lately are movies that don't require much thinking at all. They're just films that are entertainment and action alone.Here's a brief explanation of the movie, if you don't want to know what happens, skip this paragraph. Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling) is driving a car with his girlfriend and family in it on some bridge (I forget which one it is) in the NYC area. An accident occurs and we see Henry between life and death while the other three people in the car have already died. The movie is then about what Henry is seeing as he's about to die. In the real world, Ewan Mcgregor's character Sam, and Lila (Naomi Watts) are helping him out until the paramedics can come and help. The movie we see is Henry's made up world containing Sam and Lila, where Sam is just helping a suicidal Henry and Lila is Sam's girlfriend. Other people he remembers seeing from the accident make short appearances in his made up world. Thus, the film is relatively confusing to some people, and I'm sure I haven't explained it as well as I could.In the end, I say go rent this movie when it's avail",4
Ramai,"It would be cruel to reveal anything about the story before seeing this film because most of the enjoyment is learning which path the story will choose.The film has masterful visual style. At times it appears to be a normal picture until the surreal aspects make themselves known with subtlety. The editing is seamless, almost but not quite confusing, and the callbacks to earlier scenes are never overused.It is not a spoiler to state that early on Something Isn't Quite Right, and there are story elements that the avid moviegoer will know to be central to the conclusion. However, it's the path that leads to the end that makes the time enjoyable.Naomi Watts, as usual, is perfect, and Ewan McGregor has again picked one of the scripts that was for the art and not the money. Ryan Gosling is effective, and Jeanine Garafolo's three minutes were eerie. I'm certain that Elizabeth Reaser will be seen again.Not a perfect movie, but definitely worth the time if you enjoy surrealistic stories.8/10",4
Ramai,"I saw this in the cinema solely because I had nothing else to do and that Ewan McGregor was in it. I had no idea what it was about. I am so glad that I watched it, because this film left me thinking for ages.This is a thriller about a psychiatrist (which I happen to be one) trying to help a depressed & suicidal patient. The film twists unexpectedly all the time without getting bizarre. The visual effects are stunning, and the soundtrack created the eerie atmosphere which gave me creeps. The best thing about this film is that the film keeps you in suspense throughout the film, without the use of sudden loud noises, gore or scary scenes. Everything in the film seemed so every day life (to me anyway) and yet it keeps you on the edge all the time. The interspersed scenes of unrelated objects creates suspense in a way that is surreal. In the ending, I was totally surprised at that happened. I had to really think a lot to figure out what happened. Usually, when I don't understand a film, I say it is bad bad bad, but for this film, it leaves me wanting to find out more about it.I strongly recommend anyone to watch this film!",0
Ramai,"As stated in the subject, this film is pure brilliance! The story is not completely original, it draws small inspirations from such films as ""Identity"", ""Fight Club"", ""12 Monkeys"" and even a little ""Sixth Sense"". But don't let that deter you if you did not care for those films! ""Stay"" is pure, cinematic genius from beginning to end.Marc Forster is probably one of the greatest up-and-coming directors of our time. What he's done with this film will make any cinephile drool with delight. There are so many innovative camera techniques that your eyes experience a sensory overload of pure genius. One of these trademarks is a technique where he transitions from one setting to another while still making you think you're in the previous scene for a few seconds. For example, in a scene where we see Ewen McGregor's character in a shop, the camera then switches views to the glass door of the shop, which we see another important character looking through it. The door opens and the character walks through, at which point we realize he was going through a subway door in a totally different scene. Forster uses this technique, as well as many other amazing tricks, throughout, and it's no less brilliant every time we see it them.As I said, the plot will remind you of a few other movies, yet the actual twisted ending, and the avenue which Forster and the writers take us there, is so completely different and interesting that this film simply must be seen.McGregor did a fantastic job as psychiatrist Sam Foster, and Gosling was unbelievably realistic and convincing as the mentally unstable patient. Of special note is Bob Hoskin's almost cameo role as Foster's friend Leon. His character is so sympathetic and believable that it almost made me cry.As usual with such films as last years ""The Jacket"", this movie was marketed as some supernatural horror film, but it's by no means a horror film. In fact I went into this movie dreading all the jump scenes and disturbing, weirdness that would make me run from my car to my front door at night, but really this is a straight up thriller in the vein of ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Sixth Sense"" (minus the ghostly appearances and dead people).If you consider yourself someone who is tired of Hollywood's big-budget, slam-bang drivel and want to actually have your brain scrambling with thoughts throughout an entire film, RUN, do not walk, and see this film.",5
Ramai,"Ultimately it's a richly textured, multi-faceted look at the relationship between guilt and love, death and life. Suicidal themes run amuck, so, as you can imagine, there are many dark, intense scenes between talented actors. And the performances really are great, as is the mind-bending cinematography. But its way overwritten...the truly brilliant ""interesting plot device"" mingles but never bonds with the characters or dialogue, so everything falls flat. It's not rewarding, because insignificant elements overshadow details crucial to experiencing the intended impact of the film.If you want to see an astonishingly filmed, well acted movie, here it is, have fun...But Stay breaks the first commandment of film-making because it takes itself more seriously than its subject. At the end of the day, the message the filmmakers seem to communicate is, ""see what we did!"" instead of ""see what we mean.""",3
Ramai,"I can honestly say that this is one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen. I was speechless when I got through with this movie. I just cannot believe how complex this movie is. It had so many levels to it. Mark Forster is an absolute genius.The plots basically centers around two characters, Sam Foster(Ewan McGregor) and Henry Letham(Ryan Gosling). Sam is a psychiatrist who deals mostly with neurotic stockbrokers, but at the beginning of the movie he is filling in for one of his colleagues. That is how he comes to meet Henry. Henry is a very strange Art student who idolizes this artist named Tristan Reveur. Reveur was a magnificent artist who burned all his paintings and committed suicide on his 21st birthday (he actually told people he was going to do this on when he was 18). Henry decides that he wants to leave the same mark and tells Sam that he is going to commit suicide on midnight of his 21st birthday. It then becomes Sam's job to try and stop him, but during that promise Sam must also fight to keep his own grip with reality.This movie will mess with your head throughout the entire film. It is a very artistic film, and the whole concept of art (painting, drama, literature, etc.) holds the plot together. The most amazing part of this film however is the complexity of it. I still cannot believe how Forster was able to tie all these characters together the way he did, it really was a work of art. By the time you reach the end of this film you will be utterly amazed. In my opinion this is a true masterpiece. I'm going to leave this with my favorite quote from the movie: ""Bad art is more tragically beautiful than good art, because it documents human failing."" - Tristan Reveur",5
Ramai,"STAY is a strange bird of a movie, one that you must be rested and in the mood for to watch, and one that asks that you forget the usual linear storyline and stay alert every minute. Directed by Marc Forster (Monster Ball, Finding Neverland, and the upcoming The Kite Runner) and based on a story and screenplay by David Benioff (Troy, The 25th Hour, and the upcoming The Kite Runner!), STAY is more a mind-bending visual excursion that explores some dark psychological questions dealing with life, death, suicide, occult, and a mlange of all of these.The opening of the film is a twisted visual experience that has to do with a car crashing on a bridge, fire, and a body - all given during the opening credits. We then meet psychiatrist Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) as he encounters a college student patient Henry Lethem (Ryan Gosling) whom he is seeing for his colleague, the emotionally exhausted Dr. Beth Levy (Janeane Garofalo). Hesitant to work with a 'substitute psychiatrist' Henry eventually tells Sam he is planning to commit suicide that Saturday at midnight, a re-enactment of his painter idol's absurd life. Sam's artist girlfriend Lila (Naomi Watts) was herself a suicide attempt rescued by Sam and offers her help in dealing with Sam's patient. Sam also gleans advice from his mentor, the blind Dr Patterson (Bob Hoskins) and after numerous attempts to contact his associate Beth for information, Sam strikes out on his own in an attempt to understand Henry before he destroys himself. He looks up Henry's mother (Kate Burton) whom Henry says is dead, discovers when Henry meets Dr Patterson that Henry claims Patterson is his father and is also dead. Ultimately Sam engages the services of a mental institution run by Dr Ren (BD Wong) and gains the promise that the institution will put a hold on Henry so that he will be unable to commit suicide.In the midst of this race Sam's world begins to crumble, people don't make sense, stories clash, and Sam tumbles around in a state closely resembling madness until the final frames when the entire situation of the film is made clear. Nothing is as it appears when dealing with the thread that separates life and death. The script is clumsy, the camera work is distractingly of kilter, little gimmicks are used to the extreme, and the tiny roles of supporting characters hardly merit the gifted actors such as Hoskins, Burton, and Garofalo. Ryan Gosling is again tossed into a role that is starchy and unidimensional and despite his fine work his character remains aloof. McGregor and Watts do the best they can with the script but end up becoming tropes wandering in from other similar stories.So why give the film 8/10 score? Because despite all the defects it does engage the mind and forces the viewer to set aside the general principles of understanding and just release the mind to a crazy ride. That is healthy film making and deserves attention. Grady Harp",4
Ramai,"After a car accident on a bridge, the psychiatrist Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) assumes the case of the survivor Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling), who apparently torched and car and promises to commit suicide three days later. Sam decides to investigate deeper what happened with Henry, and feels that he is becoming detached from reality with his findings about the case. He asks his girlfriend Lila Culpepper (Naomi Watts) to help himself to stay lucid, while trying to solve the intriguing situation of Henry.I am a great fan of director Marc Foster, with his dramatic ""Everything Put Together"" and ""Monster's Ball"", and the wonderful ""Finding Neverland"". However, ""Stay"" is absolutely different from the foregoing movies, being a kind of ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Jacob's Ladder"" with a David Lynch style. The screenplay is very intriguing and challenging, with weird situations, and there is a catch in the end with Sam Foster vision when the truth is finally disclosed. The beautiful cinematography gives the sensation of a dream, or nightmare, to the viewer. This compelling film is attractive and deserves to be watched more than once. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Passagem"" (""The Passage"")",4
Ramai,"Understandably, there is so much debate about the context of this movie, what it means, if it's genius or pointless, what's actually going on, etc., etc., etc. In a nutshell, I'm summarizing the most prominent aspects of what I gathered this movie to portray because it seems it's been treated with so much intrication and over-analyzing: A kid is in the process of his life and consciousness fading out as, in REALITY, he has just experienced a fatal car accident. The whole movie takes place from the perspective *of what's going on in his head*. His subconscious and various other mental processes and brain activity is going to work, which constitutes most of what you see in the movie. That explains all the non-real events that occur from time to time throughout the movie. Nothing too clever because again as we find out, it was all not reality. It would have been quite the trick if it in fact was reality, and somehow they had an explanation where it all made sense. But in that case, one could argue that there would be no real theoretical value to the movie.Anyway, what the dying character is doing subconsciously, is ""pulling"" in people surrounding him from the outside or in reality, and has represented them as characters in his dream-state. The main character, Ewan McGregor, in his mind is the psychologist trying to save him from dying, parallel to that in reality, the person of an entirely different form who is trying to save his life from the injuries of his car accident.The movie depicts events that set out to question or challenge the state of reality in our minds, what is real, how what isn't real can transcend with what is real, and vice versa. Basically, the whole ""life is but a dream"" spill.But alas, where have we seen this before? Well, unfortunately this movie joins the masses of other reality/mind-bending movies (i.e., The Matrix, The Jacket, Secret Window, The Butterfly Effect) that set out to get the wheels turning over the true nature of our existence in conjunction with reality and fantasy, dreams, and perception as a whole.For that reason, as well constructed and beautifully executed as this movie was on an aesthetic level, I found nothing new from the movie and all of the mind-bending events simply being chalked up to the kids brain wigging out while he is in the process of dying left me feeling extremely disappointed and almost used. In all honestly, in the back of my mind I kind of gathered this is what the movie was all about, but desperately indulged in the hope of wanting there to be something more to the ending than again, it just pretty much being all a dream - which is something I consider to be the cheapest and lamest way to culminate the events of a plot.In the end, there wasn't more to it...just strange events that turn out to be the kids fading mind and a few symbolic events that ONCE AGAIN, propose the speculation of reality.My position on this movie is don't buy into the overused science. This movie is not all that clever, or the work of art that a lot of reviewers are deeming it. This movie is just a somewhat satisfying and intriguing experience until the ending hits and what once stimulated the senses to a degree, now feeds it dog food.",3
Ramai,"It is a truism that film, as a photographic medium, intrinsically resists the psychological. In the hands of a less gifted director, this would have been equally true of STAY, despite its overt plot in which a professor of psychiatry struggles to find a psychological clue in order to prevent a young artist from committing suicide at a precise time and location the artist has planned. But without altering this plot as written, director Marc Forster has invented an editing style (combined with a rigorous control of transitions and point of view) to create nothing less than a parallel plot to the film, in which the professor must contend with the horror of his own descent into full-blown psychosis.Since the director conveys this parallel plot entirely through visual means, and within the point of view of the hero of the story, its consequences are all the more disconcerting, and we feel the terror of the realization of losing one's mind more acutely than in any previous screen depiction of madness I have seen.Much as the young artist's psychotic identity implicitly consumes the identity of his psychiatrist, so does the visual plot consume the overt, written plot of the film, like an unconscious motivation that overcomes a conscious one. By succeeding with such an ambitious design, Forster has invented a new kind of film in which the psychological, in all its frightening depths, finally becomes visible.",5
Ramai,"I like a movie that makes you think. ""Stay"" is that type of movie. Right off the bat, the director makes it clear that this not a straight-forward narrative so pay attention...there is unusual stuff coming...puzzle pieces...imagery...hints...oddities...quirks...visual weirdness...deepness. With this type of movie, the director is making a deal with you...stick with this movie, ride out the confusion, and I will deliver to you, as a reward, an effective ending or, at least, some satisfaction.Unfortunately, ""Stay"" does not deliver. The movie is so steeped in visual tricks, symbolism, and strangeness it becomes a chore. The movie became tedious, with each scene trying to be more clever than the last. My friends and I gave up trying to put together the pieces and began to obsess on Ewan McGregor's weird high-water pants. We guessed...hmmm, we've seen this stuff before (dream? split personality? is someone dead and doesn't know it?) Truly, you could go scene by scene dissecting the weirdness (the kid with the balloon, the twins and triplets walking around, the Bob Hoskins character, etc.) It's just too much work.The movie had a couple of redeeming qualities. The director seemed to experiment with every conceivable camera angle possible, which, at times, was intriguing. The editing, while jarring, was expertly done. Also, Ryan Gosling was compelling as the mysterious suicidal young guy. Unfortunately, Ewan McGregor and his pants were badly miscast and Naomi Watts is forgettable.And the ending. Cop out. While it provided a small ""aha"", it was unoriginal and unsatisfying. Probably most savvy movie goers had it pretty much figured out anyway (or close to it). In the end, the movie is not nearly as smart as it thinks it is. It is like getting a 10,000 piece puzzle and realizing it's not worth the effort to put it together.",2
Ramai,"If you have not seen this movie don't read this review. Go see the movie and then come back if you feel the need. This is a brilliant film. I loved every aspect of it. It does, however, take some work on the part of the viewer to reap the full benefits of it's brilliance. Here's my take.Ryan Gosling plays Henry, an art student, out on the town with his soon to be fianc and his parents. He has an engagement ring in his pocket, (you won't know that until later though), and he is the driver of the car that is carrying them all across the Brooklyn Bridge. They are involved in a fiery crash. This happens in the first few minutes of the film. What follows is the nightmarish moments, it could be minutes, it could be seconds, between life and death. A place you cannot ""Stay"".At the core of this film is guilt and loss. Henry, begging ""fogive me"", asking himself if he is responsible for the deaths of his parents and his girlfriend. He's slipping away and it's not peaceful. The shock at the end of this movie was only outdone by it's sadness, (will you marry me?). It is brilliantly told, and deliberately confusing until the end to great affect because dying is not neat and clean. We're left here to imagine, to the best of our ability, what goes through the mind of someone who dies of a head injury in a traumatic car crash. It is difficult to imagine, unless you've experienced it yourself, what goes through your mind when you think you're dead. Or you're actually dying. This movie comes about as close as anything I have ever seen. The cast does the story huge justice. Ryan Gosling, Ewan McGregor, and Naomi Watts, are excellent. The director, writer, and editor painted a Van Gough. Bravo!",5
Ramai,"First off, anyone that says this is an intelligent film and that you have to be smart to get it is only showing their ignorance. A third-grader could have figured out the end of this movie about half way through.I have to agree with a previous comment by find-something: ""The twist is just not tight enough. If you're going to write a story where ultimately nothing happens, then the twist better be brilliant, I mean perfect.""EXACTLY. There is no intellectual payoff in this movie. All style, no substance. Look at how many people like this ""intelligent"" movie... doesn't that tell you something? I know this probably sounds elitist or something, but I guess I just expect my art to actually try to say something. This is just a marginally smarter version of a Hollywood blockbuster -- great cinematography and effects, wonderful acting, clever writing (too clever, I'd say) -- but in the end, it just cops out and lets all the dramatic tension drift away into nothingness. A lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",2
Ramai,"I am reminded of an old favorite film of mine, made in the 1970's, called The Lathe of Heaven. The Lathe of Heaven was a masterful piece of science fiction writing by Ursula Le Guin and the premise of the movie was that within one's own mind, you both create and are created.In Stay and The Lathe, the central figure is between life and death, a place where the plane between the conscious and subconscious is blurred and lacking in definition ... a place where memories and reality collide and overlap. In both, the central figure is initially unaware of his power to affect, impact and alter anything and everything within this newly found (or rather created) world. In fact, they are merely lost souls trying to find answers from the cast of characters their mind has either created or that they have molded from reality or memory.In Stay, as the functions of Henry's brain decline and the transition between worlds is completed, the focus returns to reality and the perspective of other conscious minds. Unaware of the roles they played in helping Henry cross over, their lives return to normal. In Lathe of Heaven (is Henry Latham an anagram of sorts? hmmm), one of the characters becomes painfully aware that his being, as well as all others in his world, is tied to the existence of the central character.Thought-provoking symbolism, masterful transition effects, artistic blending of architecture and scenery against the surreal backdrop of a diminishing mind all make this a must see, must have film. No doubt a special conversation piece for the collector!",4
Ramai,"This movie, along the guidelines of ""Identity"" and ""Fight Club,"" is a terrific psychological thriller. The subtle nuances within the movie (the doubles & triplicates of things, like the twins, triplets, the 2121 on top of the ambulance alluding to the connection between Henry and Sam and/or Lila and Athena & to Henry's 21st birthday; it also alludes to the repetition within the story, as Henry's mind is playing things over and over while his brain is dying). At the end, it almost seems like Henry and Athena are reincarnated within Sam and Lila. The hints here and there still give you no clue until the end about what's really going on (the crying baby, the voices he hears, the woman saying ""He's just a kid,"" the couple saying ""He's not going to make it,"" the child asking if he was going to die, the piano ominously hanging above like a death trap, his artwork, the lost ring...everything). It seemed also that he was trying to make amens while he was dying (curing his father's blindness; and that he wanted to be forgiven, because he thought he had done something wrong). The people are puzzle pieces that he puts together in his story of his life simply because they are there and maybe a little bit more than that (it's for you to decide). And I believe that Henry's shooting himself was his way of choosing to STAY or go during his near death experience; he obviously chooses to go. Lila almost seems like the other choice, though; she says, ""There's just too much goddamn beauty to quit."" It's like she's the decision to stay, while Henry's suicidal thoughts are his decision to go. It's funny, you always hear of near death experiences, but it's strange to hear of a death experience. This is an excellent movie that I believe everyone should see; it will truly make you think differently about life and death as a whole.",5
Ramai,"this movie is blissful confusion, the acting on Ewan and Ryan's part was amazing, wish we had seen more of Naomi though.. too bad, this movie is full of twist and turns, if anyone has seen ""a spiders web"", its a little like that, and a touch like Donnie Darko, minus the crazed demon bunny, a truly beautifully shot film,the director, and director of photography,should both be given an awarded for the way it was shot, any one who can appreciate art can appreciate this movie, between the flow shot's, and the fades, it was amazing, and i was in awe, i fully recommend it of you haven't seen it, its worth the price of admission, and will loose a great deal of it's affect on a small screen, or regular TV, again i urge you to go see it while it's still in theaters",5
Ramai,"The real mystery in this movie is what attracted such an A-list group of stars (Ewan Macgregor, Naomi Watts, Ryan Gosling, Bob Hoskins, etc.) to such a poorly-written and imagined screenplay. The whole thing plays out like an ultra-cheesy episode of _The Twilight Zone_, though at almost 100 minutes, your patience is likely to run out long before the climactic ""reveal"" that supposedly ties everything together. I say ""supposedly"" because I don't think it does tie anything together--you're likely to have just as many, if not more, questions at the end. I was suckered in by mysterious trailers that made this film seem to be something intriguing and mysterious, and it is that, but people want answers. The whole thing seems to promise a final twist along the lines of _The Sixth Sense_, but there's just nothing. It's a very self-consciously arty film (one critic I read called it a ""look-what-I-learned-in film-school"" film--good description), with a theme and story than might seem weighty to an eight-grader. If you're familiar with _Jacob's Ladder_ or _Carnival of Souls_ or Ambrose Bierce's story ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" then you've already seen this story before, and you should save your money and your time. I found myself wishing I'd gone to see _Doom_ instead.",1
Ramai,"Overall quality of this film is good, if I had never saw The I Inside (2003) before, I would have rated it 9/10.This film borrow ideas from The I Inside (2003), they both deal with illusion when someone suffers death, when the brain try to make a reasonable conclusion of what happened by mixing the information picked from reality, previous experience, emotions and wishes.From my point of view the plot of Stay is not as gripping as The I Inside, the later one do a better job keeping you trying to figure out what on earth happened by keep the brain-made world convincing till the second half of the film. Stay just introduced turbulence of the fake world at the very start, which may be an approach to giving the audiences sufficient time to guess and understand the real situation, but fails to interest astute audience like me.",3
Ramai,"Finally, a philosophical and scientific movie! I love the reference to Freud: A father had been watching day and night beside the sick-bed of his child. After the child died, he retired to rest in an adjoining room, but left the door ajar so that he could look from his room into the next, where the child's body lay surrounded by tall candles. An old man, who had been installed as a watcher, sat beside the body, murmuring prayers. After sleeping for a few hours the father dreamed that the child was standing by his bed, clasping his arm and crying reproachfully: 'Father, don't you see that I am burning?' The father woke up and noticed a bright light coming from the adjoining room. Rushing in, he found that the old man had fallen asleep, and the sheets and one arm of the beloved body were burnt by a fallen candle.And another interesting thing is at the end, the reference to gateways to another dimension. When they are standing on the Brooklyn Bridge and both are surrounded by strange lines. It indicated that Henry is about to leave this world and travel to an alternate dimension.Awesome movie.",5
Ramai,"I only saw the the pre-screening of the film not the final edition, but I loved the movie. The ""surprise"" ending is a little overused, but the way the movie uses the perspective of the story to confuse the viewer was great. I thought this was a great film and I love Naomi Watts. My wife however didn't enjoy it mainly because she didn't get it. Those of us in the post viewing discussion group here in Pasadena that liked it were fairly intelligent and understood the movie, and the people who didn't like it, not only didn't understand what had happened at the end, they had trouble understanding it when explained. If you enjoy movies that make you think, and you like to try and figure out movies that have something strange going on behind the scenes this movie is for you. And again it is worth see just to see another good showing by Naomi Watts.",4
Nirahua Chalal London,"Have you heard of Stay? If you're here you must have but I'll bet it wasn't too long ago that you found out about it. It's a movie that came out late last year with little fanfare, was dismissed as a poor movie by critics and quickly ushered back out of theaters.It's a crying shame.It was a wonderful movie. My favorite type of movies are psychological horror movies. Favorites include: Jacob's Ladder, Mulholland Dr., Donnie Darko, and in a similar realm, Momento and Fight Club. I love seeing a good representation of the human mind on film and that is exactly what this film shows so well.It's about a college student (Ryan Gosling) who tells his shrink (Ewan McGregor) that he is going to kill himself on the stroke of midnight this Saturday, leaving his shrink to enlist the help of his formerly suicidal girlfriend (Naomi Watts) to figure out why he wants to kill himself and how to stop him, while his world falls apart.It's directed by Marc Forster of Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland fame. The movie has been called pretentious, shallow, ridiculous, bewildering, absurd, and empty by many reviewers. Personally I think that they didn't have the patience for it and/or were put off by its extravagant visuals and cuts. I thought it was great and deserves much more credit than it has received.The movie's visual style is very interesting and jarring in a good way. It had me constantly saying to my girlfriend ""did you see that?"" Full of slight of the hand camera/editing tricks. Nearly everything in the movie is symbolic of other things or ideas in the movie. The acting is very good, especially among the lesser characters. Everything in the movie feels so unreal, but that is serves some purpose even if one couldn't know what it is right away. A second viewing would reveal many new things. In the end much of the movie is left up to interpretation and my girlfriend and I had a good conversation about our ideas on what things meant in the movie. After thinking about it for a day I'm pretty sure that I could explain everything in the movie, even what the hell is up with Ewan McGregor's pants, Why Gosling wanted to commit suicide and the twins and triplets.It was fun was figuring out what the rest of the movie meant after seeing its end, the solution. The movie is like a code and the end is the decryption key. It differs from other ""sixth sense"" type surprise ending movies because everything you would see in the movie before the end would not act as a clue to what it all means or what the ending is. It's more like decrypting a diary than a problem with a solution to it.Basically, any movie buff owes it to themselves to see this movie. I rented it but after seeing it I fully intend to purchase the DVD.",5
Nirahua Chalal London,"I think the very first movie I ever saw that absolutely required a second viewing was Angel Heart, back in 1987. The second viewing is necessary because after you know what you know from the initial viewing, you get to watch an entirely different film the second time around. Angel Heart was considered before its time when it was released, and since then, indeed there has been a spate of these kinds of films, some more successful than others.Stay is one of these 2-films-in-1 experiences, but this film, unfortunately, is not as successful (in my eyes) as, say, The Sixth Sense, Memento, The Machinist or even Angel Heart. Those films succeed brilliantly because they manage to evoke a chilling impact on the viewer by the end. Stay, on the other hand, left me more confused than anything, even though I understood what had happened: -=- SPOILER ALERT -=- The film takes place in the consciousness of Ryan Gosling's character, Henry, who is teetering between life and death after a terrible car accident which killed the other passengers in his vehicle (his mother, his father and his soon-to-be-fiance). This is a horrendous tragedy, what has happened to Henry: if you can imagine being near death but yet aware that your 3 closest loved ones have been killed in an accident that you inadvertently caused (his tire blew out) - this is a monumentally sad thing to have happen to you, but yet this sadness was not effectively conveyed at the end of the movie because I was instead confused about what had transpired and I had to think about it in depth afterwards to realize that Ewan McGregor's character Sam (who seemed to be the main character of the movie) was also part of Henry's semi-conscious hallucinatory state.There were just too many scenes in the film that Henry didn't appear in (although McGregor and the always-fantastic Naomi Watts are perfectly cast in their 'roles', as is Gosling). In retrospect, I think this is what caused the confusion and left me not feeling the impact that should have been felt at the realization of what had just transpired. -=- END OF SPOILER. -=-I don't like making comparisons, but The Sixth Sense, for instance, was hugely successful because it was written in such a way that it included the viewer in Bruce Willis' shocking realization at the end; it has the impact it does (even on repeat viewings!) because of the masterful way it's staged.What I'm saying is, while Stay is a noble and ambitious effort and still worthy (in my opinion) of a couple of viewings, it's not enough to have a movie that becomes a second movie once you've seen it - the movie has to stand on its own the FIRST time; the impact has to be there the first time or there's no genuine payoff for the viewer. I love a movie that haunts you afterwards and makes you think, that's the best kind of film, but there does have to be that impact the first time, that all-important creeping sense of realization that makes your eyes go wide and gives you goosebumps.",3
Nirahua Chalal London,"It's hard to comment on this film without including a spoiler, but I feel it is necessary to try because of all of the unwarranted bad reviews this film is receiving. If you go into it expecting to see a rendition of The 6th Sense, you might be disappointed. If you go into it expecting to see a logical plot with a chronological story behind it and an honest portrayal of developed characters, you will be disappointed and very confused.However, if you go see this film with an open mind and simply EXPERIENCE what it has to offer, you will be rewarded greatly at the end - assuming, of course, that you understand what you have just seen, at least to some degree. For the best experience, pay attention to the little details, but don't try to figure anything out until the end. See it with someone so that you can discuss it afterward. It's that good.This movie is visually appealing and artistically constructed - pleasing to both the eye AND to the mind.",5
Nirahua Chalal London,"There is such a debate about this movie, on side arguing that you can ""get it"" if you are intelligent enough and the other arguing there is nothing to ""get."" Why don't you all stop worrying about whether or not you get it or not. Movies are art, and art is open to different interpretations. There is no right or wrong, and to steal a quote that I loved, (I can't remember exactly ""Bad Art is even better because it documents human failure"") sorry that quote wasn't really necessary and didn't fit my point exactly but I was just dying to use it.Anyway my main interpretation of the movie is to show the intricacies of the human brain. A man went through a serious shock/trauma, going unconscious, allowing his subconscious to come out and play, the movie demonstrates the power of the subconscious, pulling out stored tidbits of information from the brain received by the human senses. The movie documents not the man's physical struggle to stay alive but his mental one. With his brain setting up a maze of obstacles to get past to regain consciousness/life. In this maze of his mind I think his actual self represents death or the coming of death, and he is in the form of the psychologist (mcgregor) trying to work his way through the maze to fight to stay alive. I think this is why we saw the movie makes such a point of showing us that they are the same person (in his mind) I think he has chosen mcgreggor as his self because in his subconscious he knows that in the real life mcgreggor is trying to save him. As for the powers, it is his mind of course he is able to control what is happening. Leaving one end untangled, the de ja vu with mcgregor and watts at the end. To go with the flow of this interpretation, that the movie is demonstrating the power of the human mind, perhaps subconsciously the mans dream was able to affect the other people involved, through psychic powers, I'm not sure on this, this is a tough cookie.Of course another interpretation of this movie could possibly be two parrelel worlds colliding through an event (car crash) I don't know for sure I can only make my own interpretations, and I like this movie because of the different ways it can be interpreted, unlike most Hollywood movies, which leave no room for the imagination. This is art, good art: 8/10",4
Nirahua Chalal London,"This is really a spectacular film. I know I'm going to have to see it at least once more, because there's so much stuff going on that it's impossible to give Stay the attention in deserves in one viewing.First and foremost, although I won't give away the plot here, I'll say that the movie (thankfully) does not rely on a surprise ending for the totality of its impact. In fact, if you're paying attention, you can pretty much figure out (mostly) what the situation is before you get too far into the movie. Unlike some of the worst examples of this genre (i.e. The Sixth Sense), Stay is not a film that ""hides the ball,"" but instead presents you with characters and a storyline, and asks you to draw your own conclusions.That said, there isn't an obvious solution to the movie. While you may be able to explain the film after viewing it (which is trickier that it will seem at first), you may realize that the real brilliance of this film is in the levels of its narrative. At its core, it is a basic psychological thriller. Simultaneously, and perhaps subconsciously, it also meditates on weighty issues of reality and identity- consider what the imperative ""Stay"" means to different characters at different points in the film, and it's almost like you're watching an entirely different movie than you originally thought.Finally, the visuals in this movie provide their own context and narrative regarding the fragile nature of human memory and perception. This is the best looking movie I've seen in a long time, and the fact that it's combined with such a great story and cast makes this a rare treat.If there is a weak link here, it's probably Gosling, who I think missed some opportunities to really dig in with his character and creep us out. Still his acting is better than that of most of Hollywood's garbage these days.Final verdict: if you want a smart and unsettling film that will spur a serious discussion, watch this. You won't be disappointed.",5
Nirahua Chalal London,"For the few people that saw this film, it seems that people either love it or hate it, but that's the case with a lot of films these days. I thought the film was brilliant just because of how well thought out it was and it keeps you guessing till the end. Some movie goers aren't patient enough for a film like that.A lot of the hits, at least in the states, lately are movies that don't require much thinking at all. They're just films that are entertainment and action alone.Here's a brief explanation of the movie, if you don't want to know what happens, skip this paragraph. Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling) is driving a car with his girlfriend and family in it on some bridge (I forget which one it is) in the NYC area. An accident occurs and we see Henry between life and death while the other three people in the car have already died. The movie is then about what Henry is seeing as he's about to die. In the real world, Ewan Mcgregor's character Sam, and Lila (Naomi Watts) are helping him out until the paramedics can come and help. The movie we see is Henry's made up world containing Sam and Lila, where Sam is just helping a suicidal Henry and Lila is Sam's girlfriend. Other people he remembers seeing from the accident make short appearances in his made up world. Thus, the film is relatively confusing to some people, and I'm sure I haven't explained it as well as I could.In the end, I say go rent this movie when it's avail",4
Nirahua Chalal London,"It would be cruel to reveal anything about the story before seeing this film because most of the enjoyment is learning which path the story will choose.The film has masterful visual style. At times it appears to be a normal picture until the surreal aspects make themselves known with subtlety. The editing is seamless, almost but not quite confusing, and the callbacks to earlier scenes are never overused.It is not a spoiler to state that early on Something Isn't Quite Right, and there are story elements that the avid moviegoer will know to be central to the conclusion. However, it's the path that leads to the end that makes the time enjoyable.Naomi Watts, as usual, is perfect, and Ewan McGregor has again picked one of the scripts that was for the art and not the money. Ryan Gosling is effective, and Jeanine Garafolo's three minutes were eerie. I'm certain that Elizabeth Reaser will be seen again.Not a perfect movie, but definitely worth the time if you enjoy surrealistic stories.8/10",4
Nirahua Chalal London,"I saw this in the cinema solely because I had nothing else to do and that Ewan McGregor was in it. I had no idea what it was about. I am so glad that I watched it, because this film left me thinking for ages.This is a thriller about a psychiatrist (which I happen to be one) trying to help a depressed & suicidal patient. The film twists unexpectedly all the time without getting bizarre. The visual effects are stunning, and the soundtrack created the eerie atmosphere which gave me creeps. The best thing about this film is that the film keeps you in suspense throughout the film, without the use of sudden loud noises, gore or scary scenes. Everything in the film seemed so every day life (to me anyway) and yet it keeps you on the edge all the time. The interspersed scenes of unrelated objects creates suspense in a way that is surreal. In the ending, I was totally surprised at that happened. I had to really think a lot to figure out what happened. Usually, when I don't understand a film, I say it is bad bad bad, but for this film, it leaves me wanting to find out more about it.I strongly recommend anyone to watch this film!",0
Nirahua Chalal London,"As stated in the subject, this film is pure brilliance! The story is not completely original, it draws small inspirations from such films as ""Identity"", ""Fight Club"", ""12 Monkeys"" and even a little ""Sixth Sense"". But don't let that deter you if you did not care for those films! ""Stay"" is pure, cinematic genius from beginning to end.Marc Forster is probably one of the greatest up-and-coming directors of our time. What he's done with this film will make any cinephile drool with delight. There are so many innovative camera techniques that your eyes experience a sensory overload of pure genius. One of these trademarks is a technique where he transitions from one setting to another while still making you think you're in the previous scene for a few seconds. For example, in a scene where we see Ewen McGregor's character in a shop, the camera then switches views to the glass door of the shop, which we see another important character looking through it. The door opens and the character walks through, at which point we realize he was going through a subway door in a totally different scene. Forster uses this technique, as well as many other amazing tricks, throughout, and it's no less brilliant every time we see it them.As I said, the plot will remind you of a few other movies, yet the actual twisted ending, and the avenue which Forster and the writers take us there, is so completely different and interesting that this film simply must be seen.McGregor did a fantastic job as psychiatrist Sam Foster, and Gosling was unbelievably realistic and convincing as the mentally unstable patient. Of special note is Bob Hoskin's almost cameo role as Foster's friend Leon. His character is so sympathetic and believable that it almost made me cry.As usual with such films as last years ""The Jacket"", this movie was marketed as some supernatural horror film, but it's by no means a horror film. In fact I went into this movie dreading all the jump scenes and disturbing, weirdness that would make me run from my car to my front door at night, but really this is a straight up thriller in the vein of ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Sixth Sense"" (minus the ghostly appearances and dead people).If you consider yourself someone who is tired of Hollywood's big-budget, slam-bang drivel and want to actually have your brain scrambling with thoughts throughout an entire film, RUN, do not walk, and see this film.",5
Nirahua Chalal London,"Ultimately it's a richly textured, multi-faceted look at the relationship between guilt and love, death and life. Suicidal themes run amuck, so, as you can imagine, there are many dark, intense scenes between talented actors. And the performances really are great, as is the mind-bending cinematography. But its way overwritten...the truly brilliant ""interesting plot device"" mingles but never bonds with the characters or dialogue, so everything falls flat. It's not rewarding, because insignificant elements overshadow details crucial to experiencing the intended impact of the film.If you want to see an astonishingly filmed, well acted movie, here it is, have fun...But Stay breaks the first commandment of film-making because it takes itself more seriously than its subject. At the end of the day, the message the filmmakers seem to communicate is, ""see what we did!"" instead of ""see what we mean.""",3
Nirahua Chalal London,"I can honestly say that this is one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen. I was speechless when I got through with this movie. I just cannot believe how complex this movie is. It had so many levels to it. Mark Forster is an absolute genius.The plots basically centers around two characters, Sam Foster(Ewan McGregor) and Henry Letham(Ryan Gosling). Sam is a psychiatrist who deals mostly with neurotic stockbrokers, but at the beginning of the movie he is filling in for one of his colleagues. That is how he comes to meet Henry. Henry is a very strange Art student who idolizes this artist named Tristan Reveur. Reveur was a magnificent artist who burned all his paintings and committed suicide on his 21st birthday (he actually told people he was going to do this on when he was 18). Henry decides that he wants to leave the same mark and tells Sam that he is going to commit suicide on midnight of his 21st birthday. It then becomes Sam's job to try and stop him, but during that promise Sam must also fight to keep his own grip with reality.This movie will mess with your head throughout the entire film. It is a very artistic film, and the whole concept of art (painting, drama, literature, etc.) holds the plot together. The most amazing part of this film however is the complexity of it. I still cannot believe how Forster was able to tie all these characters together the way he did, it really was a work of art. By the time you reach the end of this film you will be utterly amazed. In my opinion this is a true masterpiece. I'm going to leave this with my favorite quote from the movie: ""Bad art is more tragically beautiful than good art, because it documents human failing."" - Tristan Reveur",5
Nirahua Chalal London,"STAY is a strange bird of a movie, one that you must be rested and in the mood for to watch, and one that asks that you forget the usual linear storyline and stay alert every minute. Directed by Marc Forster (Monster Ball, Finding Neverland, and the upcoming The Kite Runner) and based on a story and screenplay by David Benioff (Troy, The 25th Hour, and the upcoming The Kite Runner!), STAY is more a mind-bending visual excursion that explores some dark psychological questions dealing with life, death, suicide, occult, and a mlange of all of these.The opening of the film is a twisted visual experience that has to do with a car crashing on a bridge, fire, and a body - all given during the opening credits. We then meet psychiatrist Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) as he encounters a college student patient Henry Lethem (Ryan Gosling) whom he is seeing for his colleague, the emotionally exhausted Dr. Beth Levy (Janeane Garofalo). Hesitant to work with a 'substitute psychiatrist' Henry eventually tells Sam he is planning to commit suicide that Saturday at midnight, a re-enactment of his painter idol's absurd life. Sam's artist girlfriend Lila (Naomi Watts) was herself a suicide attempt rescued by Sam and offers her help in dealing with Sam's patient. Sam also gleans advice from his mentor, the blind Dr Patterson (Bob Hoskins) and after numerous attempts to contact his associate Beth for information, Sam strikes out on his own in an attempt to understand Henry before he destroys himself. He looks up Henry's mother (Kate Burton) whom Henry says is dead, discovers when Henry meets Dr Patterson that Henry claims Patterson is his father and is also dead. Ultimately Sam engages the services of a mental institution run by Dr Ren (BD Wong) and gains the promise that the institution will put a hold on Henry so that he will be unable to commit suicide.In the midst of this race Sam's world begins to crumble, people don't make sense, stories clash, and Sam tumbles around in a state closely resembling madness until the final frames when the entire situation of the film is made clear. Nothing is as it appears when dealing with the thread that separates life and death. The script is clumsy, the camera work is distractingly of kilter, little gimmicks are used to the extreme, and the tiny roles of supporting characters hardly merit the gifted actors such as Hoskins, Burton, and Garofalo. Ryan Gosling is again tossed into a role that is starchy and unidimensional and despite his fine work his character remains aloof. McGregor and Watts do the best they can with the script but end up becoming tropes wandering in from other similar stories.So why give the film 8/10 score? Because despite all the defects it does engage the mind and forces the viewer to set aside the general principles of understanding and just release the mind to a crazy ride. That is healthy film making and deserves attention. Grady Harp",4
Nirahua Chalal London,"After a car accident on a bridge, the psychiatrist Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) assumes the case of the survivor Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling), who apparently torched and car and promises to commit suicide three days later. Sam decides to investigate deeper what happened with Henry, and feels that he is becoming detached from reality with his findings about the case. He asks his girlfriend Lila Culpepper (Naomi Watts) to help himself to stay lucid, while trying to solve the intriguing situation of Henry.I am a great fan of director Marc Foster, with his dramatic ""Everything Put Together"" and ""Monster's Ball"", and the wonderful ""Finding Neverland"". However, ""Stay"" is absolutely different from the foregoing movies, being a kind of ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Jacob's Ladder"" with a David Lynch style. The screenplay is very intriguing and challenging, with weird situations, and there is a catch in the end with Sam Foster vision when the truth is finally disclosed. The beautiful cinematography gives the sensation of a dream, or nightmare, to the viewer. This compelling film is attractive and deserves to be watched more than once. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Passagem"" (""The Passage"")",4
Nirahua Chalal London,"Understandably, there is so much debate about the context of this movie, what it means, if it's genius or pointless, what's actually going on, etc., etc., etc. In a nutshell, I'm summarizing the most prominent aspects of what I gathered this movie to portray because it seems it's been treated with so much intrication and over-analyzing: A kid is in the process of his life and consciousness fading out as, in REALITY, he has just experienced a fatal car accident. The whole movie takes place from the perspective *of what's going on in his head*. His subconscious and various other mental processes and brain activity is going to work, which constitutes most of what you see in the movie. That explains all the non-real events that occur from time to time throughout the movie. Nothing too clever because again as we find out, it was all not reality. It would have been quite the trick if it in fact was reality, and somehow they had an explanation where it all made sense. But in that case, one could argue that there would be no real theoretical value to the movie.Anyway, what the dying character is doing subconsciously, is ""pulling"" in people surrounding him from the outside or in reality, and has represented them as characters in his dream-state. The main character, Ewan McGregor, in his mind is the psychologist trying to save him from dying, parallel to that in reality, the person of an entirely different form who is trying to save his life from the injuries of his car accident.The movie depicts events that set out to question or challenge the state of reality in our minds, what is real, how what isn't real can transcend with what is real, and vice versa. Basically, the whole ""life is but a dream"" spill.But alas, where have we seen this before? Well, unfortunately this movie joins the masses of other reality/mind-bending movies (i.e., The Matrix, The Jacket, Secret Window, The Butterfly Effect) that set out to get the wheels turning over the true nature of our existence in conjunction with reality and fantasy, dreams, and perception as a whole.For that reason, as well constructed and beautifully executed as this movie was on an aesthetic level, I found nothing new from the movie and all of the mind-bending events simply being chalked up to the kids brain wigging out while he is in the process of dying left me feeling extremely disappointed and almost used. In all honestly, in the back of my mind I kind of gathered this is what the movie was all about, but desperately indulged in the hope of wanting there to be something more to the ending than again, it just pretty much being all a dream - which is something I consider to be the cheapest and lamest way to culminate the events of a plot.In the end, there wasn't more to it...just strange events that turn out to be the kids fading mind and a few symbolic events that ONCE AGAIN, propose the speculation of reality.My position on this movie is don't buy into the overused science. This movie is not all that clever, or the work of art that a lot of reviewers are deeming it. This movie is just a somewhat satisfying and intriguing experience until the ending hits and what once stimulated the senses to a degree, now feeds it dog food.",3
Nirahua Chalal London,"It is a truism that film, as a photographic medium, intrinsically resists the psychological. In the hands of a less gifted director, this would have been equally true of STAY, despite its overt plot in which a professor of psychiatry struggles to find a psychological clue in order to prevent a young artist from committing suicide at a precise time and location the artist has planned. But without altering this plot as written, director Marc Forster has invented an editing style (combined with a rigorous control of transitions and point of view) to create nothing less than a parallel plot to the film, in which the professor must contend with the horror of his own descent into full-blown psychosis.Since the director conveys this parallel plot entirely through visual means, and within the point of view of the hero of the story, its consequences are all the more disconcerting, and we feel the terror of the realization of losing one's mind more acutely than in any previous screen depiction of madness I have seen.Much as the young artist's psychotic identity implicitly consumes the identity of his psychiatrist, so does the visual plot consume the overt, written plot of the film, like an unconscious motivation that overcomes a conscious one. By succeeding with such an ambitious design, Forster has invented a new kind of film in which the psychological, in all its frightening depths, finally becomes visible.",5
Nirahua Chalal London,"I like a movie that makes you think. ""Stay"" is that type of movie. Right off the bat, the director makes it clear that this not a straight-forward narrative so pay attention...there is unusual stuff coming...puzzle pieces...imagery...hints...oddities...quirks...visual weirdness...deepness. With this type of movie, the director is making a deal with you...stick with this movie, ride out the confusion, and I will deliver to you, as a reward, an effective ending or, at least, some satisfaction.Unfortunately, ""Stay"" does not deliver. The movie is so steeped in visual tricks, symbolism, and strangeness it becomes a chore. The movie became tedious, with each scene trying to be more clever than the last. My friends and I gave up trying to put together the pieces and began to obsess on Ewan McGregor's weird high-water pants. We guessed...hmmm, we've seen this stuff before (dream? split personality? is someone dead and doesn't know it?) Truly, you could go scene by scene dissecting the weirdness (the kid with the balloon, the twins and triplets walking around, the Bob Hoskins character, etc.) It's just too much work.The movie had a couple of redeeming qualities. The director seemed to experiment with every conceivable camera angle possible, which, at times, was intriguing. The editing, while jarring, was expertly done. Also, Ryan Gosling was compelling as the mysterious suicidal young guy. Unfortunately, Ewan McGregor and his pants were badly miscast and Naomi Watts is forgettable.And the ending. Cop out. While it provided a small ""aha"", it was unoriginal and unsatisfying. Probably most savvy movie goers had it pretty much figured out anyway (or close to it). In the end, the movie is not nearly as smart as it thinks it is. It is like getting a 10,000 piece puzzle and realizing it's not worth the effort to put it together.",2
Nirahua Chalal London,"If you have not seen this movie don't read this review. Go see the movie and then come back if you feel the need. This is a brilliant film. I loved every aspect of it. It does, however, take some work on the part of the viewer to reap the full benefits of it's brilliance. Here's my take.Ryan Gosling plays Henry, an art student, out on the town with his soon to be fianc and his parents. He has an engagement ring in his pocket, (you won't know that until later though), and he is the driver of the car that is carrying them all across the Brooklyn Bridge. They are involved in a fiery crash. This happens in the first few minutes of the film. What follows is the nightmarish moments, it could be minutes, it could be seconds, between life and death. A place you cannot ""Stay"".At the core of this film is guilt and loss. Henry, begging ""fogive me"", asking himself if he is responsible for the deaths of his parents and his girlfriend. He's slipping away and it's not peaceful. The shock at the end of this movie was only outdone by it's sadness, (will you marry me?). It is brilliantly told, and deliberately confusing until the end to great affect because dying is not neat and clean. We're left here to imagine, to the best of our ability, what goes through the mind of someone who dies of a head injury in a traumatic car crash. It is difficult to imagine, unless you've experienced it yourself, what goes through your mind when you think you're dead. Or you're actually dying. This movie comes about as close as anything I have ever seen. The cast does the story huge justice. Ryan Gosling, Ewan McGregor, and Naomi Watts, are excellent. The director, writer, and editor painted a Van Gough. Bravo!",5
Nirahua Chalal London,"First off, anyone that says this is an intelligent film and that you have to be smart to get it is only showing their ignorance. A third-grader could have figured out the end of this movie about half way through.I have to agree with a previous comment by find-something: ""The twist is just not tight enough. If you're going to write a story where ultimately nothing happens, then the twist better be brilliant, I mean perfect.""EXACTLY. There is no intellectual payoff in this movie. All style, no substance. Look at how many people like this ""intelligent"" movie... doesn't that tell you something? I know this probably sounds elitist or something, but I guess I just expect my art to actually try to say something. This is just a marginally smarter version of a Hollywood blockbuster -- great cinematography and effects, wonderful acting, clever writing (too clever, I'd say) -- but in the end, it just cops out and lets all the dramatic tension drift away into nothingness. A lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",2
Nirahua Chalal London,"I am reminded of an old favorite film of mine, made in the 1970's, called The Lathe of Heaven. The Lathe of Heaven was a masterful piece of science fiction writing by Ursula Le Guin and the premise of the movie was that within one's own mind, you both create and are created.In Stay and The Lathe, the central figure is between life and death, a place where the plane between the conscious and subconscious is blurred and lacking in definition ... a place where memories and reality collide and overlap. In both, the central figure is initially unaware of his power to affect, impact and alter anything and everything within this newly found (or rather created) world. In fact, they are merely lost souls trying to find answers from the cast of characters their mind has either created or that they have molded from reality or memory.In Stay, as the functions of Henry's brain decline and the transition between worlds is completed, the focus returns to reality and the perspective of other conscious minds. Unaware of the roles they played in helping Henry cross over, their lives return to normal. In Lathe of Heaven (is Henry Latham an anagram of sorts? hmmm), one of the characters becomes painfully aware that his being, as well as all others in his world, is tied to the existence of the central character.Thought-provoking symbolism, masterful transition effects, artistic blending of architecture and scenery against the surreal backdrop of a diminishing mind all make this a must see, must have film. No doubt a special conversation piece for the collector!",4
Nirahua Chalal London,"This movie, along the guidelines of ""Identity"" and ""Fight Club,"" is a terrific psychological thriller. The subtle nuances within the movie (the doubles & triplicates of things, like the twins, triplets, the 2121 on top of the ambulance alluding to the connection between Henry and Sam and/or Lila and Athena & to Henry's 21st birthday; it also alludes to the repetition within the story, as Henry's mind is playing things over and over while his brain is dying). At the end, it almost seems like Henry and Athena are reincarnated within Sam and Lila. The hints here and there still give you no clue until the end about what's really going on (the crying baby, the voices he hears, the woman saying ""He's just a kid,"" the couple saying ""He's not going to make it,"" the child asking if he was going to die, the piano ominously hanging above like a death trap, his artwork, the lost ring...everything). It seemed also that he was trying to make amens while he was dying (curing his father's blindness; and that he wanted to be forgiven, because he thought he had done something wrong). The people are puzzle pieces that he puts together in his story of his life simply because they are there and maybe a little bit more than that (it's for you to decide). And I believe that Henry's shooting himself was his way of choosing to STAY or go during his near death experience; he obviously chooses to go. Lila almost seems like the other choice, though; she says, ""There's just too much goddamn beauty to quit."" It's like she's the decision to stay, while Henry's suicidal thoughts are his decision to go. It's funny, you always hear of near death experiences, but it's strange to hear of a death experience. This is an excellent movie that I believe everyone should see; it will truly make you think differently about life and death as a whole.",5
Nirahua Chalal London,"this movie is blissful confusion, the acting on Ewan and Ryan's part was amazing, wish we had seen more of Naomi though.. too bad, this movie is full of twist and turns, if anyone has seen ""a spiders web"", its a little like that, and a touch like Donnie Darko, minus the crazed demon bunny, a truly beautifully shot film,the director, and director of photography,should both be given an awarded for the way it was shot, any one who can appreciate art can appreciate this movie, between the flow shot's, and the fades, it was amazing, and i was in awe, i fully recommend it of you haven't seen it, its worth the price of admission, and will loose a great deal of it's affect on a small screen, or regular TV, again i urge you to go see it while it's still in theaters",5
Nirahua Chalal London,"The real mystery in this movie is what attracted such an A-list group of stars (Ewan Macgregor, Naomi Watts, Ryan Gosling, Bob Hoskins, etc.) to such a poorly-written and imagined screenplay. The whole thing plays out like an ultra-cheesy episode of _The Twilight Zone_, though at almost 100 minutes, your patience is likely to run out long before the climactic ""reveal"" that supposedly ties everything together. I say ""supposedly"" because I don't think it does tie anything together--you're likely to have just as many, if not more, questions at the end. I was suckered in by mysterious trailers that made this film seem to be something intriguing and mysterious, and it is that, but people want answers. The whole thing seems to promise a final twist along the lines of _The Sixth Sense_, but there's just nothing. It's a very self-consciously arty film (one critic I read called it a ""look-what-I-learned-in film-school"" film--good description), with a theme and story than might seem weighty to an eight-grader. If you're familiar with _Jacob's Ladder_ or _Carnival of Souls_ or Ambrose Bierce's story ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" then you've already seen this story before, and you should save your money and your time. I found myself wishing I'd gone to see _Doom_ instead.",1
Nirahua Chalal London,"Overall quality of this film is good, if I had never saw The I Inside (2003) before, I would have rated it 9/10.This film borrow ideas from The I Inside (2003), they both deal with illusion when someone suffers death, when the brain try to make a reasonable conclusion of what happened by mixing the information picked from reality, previous experience, emotions and wishes.From my point of view the plot of Stay is not as gripping as The I Inside, the later one do a better job keeping you trying to figure out what on earth happened by keep the brain-made world convincing till the second half of the film. Stay just introduced turbulence of the fake world at the very start, which may be an approach to giving the audiences sufficient time to guess and understand the real situation, but fails to interest astute audience like me.",3
Nirahua Chalal London,"Finally, a philosophical and scientific movie! I love the reference to Freud: A father had been watching day and night beside the sick-bed of his child. After the child died, he retired to rest in an adjoining room, but left the door ajar so that he could look from his room into the next, where the child's body lay surrounded by tall candles. An old man, who had been installed as a watcher, sat beside the body, murmuring prayers. After sleeping for a few hours the father dreamed that the child was standing by his bed, clasping his arm and crying reproachfully: 'Father, don't you see that I am burning?' The father woke up and noticed a bright light coming from the adjoining room. Rushing in, he found that the old man had fallen asleep, and the sheets and one arm of the beloved body were burnt by a fallen candle.And another interesting thing is at the end, the reference to gateways to another dimension. When they are standing on the Brooklyn Bridge and both are surrounded by strange lines. It indicated that Henry is about to leave this world and travel to an alternate dimension.Awesome movie.",5
Nirahua Chalal London,"I only saw the the pre-screening of the film not the final edition, but I loved the movie. The ""surprise"" ending is a little overused, but the way the movie uses the perspective of the story to confuse the viewer was great. I thought this was a great film and I love Naomi Watts. My wife however didn't enjoy it mainly because she didn't get it. Those of us in the post viewing discussion group here in Pasadena that liked it were fairly intelligent and understood the movie, and the people who didn't like it, not only didn't understand what had happened at the end, they had trouble understanding it when explained. If you enjoy movies that make you think, and you like to try and figure out movies that have something strange going on behind the scenes this movie is for you. And again it is worth see just to see another good showing by Naomi Watts.",4
Temper,"Temper is one of the movies I have personally waited for ! NTR...who is desperately looking for a HIT, has now hit the bull's eye ! What a Characterization ! Thanks to Puri too....for designing it SO well ! Though NTR's body language sometimes reminds us of RGV, he simply rocked with his screen presence ! Story is decent though it has a very little similarities to the recent release 'Patas'....Puri, who first time took another guy's story has done his best in execution ! Just a few exceptions there ! Screenplay is mind blowing and keeps us glued to the seats ! Movie is top to bottom powerful ! Dialogues are damn good...especially in court episode (though reminds us of Rakhi) and Beach conversation ! Posani is a perfect go as a honest police officer ! Kajal is decent with her role...but her chemistry with NTR is limited....especially in second half ! Prakash Raj, Subbaraju and others have done justice to their roles ! However, few of the roles have an open ending ! And speaking about NTR's performance....a complete new look which will simply tear the silver screen apart ! This is the right time for celebration Fans.....get ready ! What a role Man...awesome it is ! Though he shows his six pack for a couple of seconds, it will surely grab few whistles out there ! First half is decent with it's narration...and with few good comedy episodes and item numbers ! Intermission Bang is good.....And the main highlight is the second half ! Highly emotional Dandayatra starts from here ! Last 30 minutes are rocking....and the end note by Puri is also great and patriotic ! There is a small cameo surprise by Puri too ! Comedy strength could have been better....the reason for this is that everything here is situational comedy instead putting off comedians illogically ! So, speaking of other things, Cinematography, Editing and Art work are simply amazing ! TEMPER is technically rich looking film ! Direction is good.....and Puri gives something opposite to Andhrawala in terms of Commercial Collections ! Production Values look rich ! Anup did a decent job....but Mani Sharma gave a fantastic BGM ! FANTASTICCCCCC....especially during opening titles !!! Lyrics are either completely meaningless or meaningful.....but what covers it is NTR's peppy steps ! A very few scenes might not go well with sensitive audience.....just remind yourself it's a Puri film ! On the whole, TEMPER is the right movie NTR fans will be looking for...As they said in the audio launch, don't forget to wear a shirt with a collar to flip after watching the film ! Also, for regular audience, TEMPER is a good commercial movie with fantastic blood boiling emotional sequences ! Just go for it with a grab of popcorn and you will come out satisfied ! NTR's DANDAYATRA started.....why late??? Just join the change !!!",5
Temper,"I used to hate NTR for only one reason, why a talented hero like him acts always in dumb and stereotype movies like Brundavanam, Dhammu, Baadhshah, Rabhasa etc., which doesn't require a talented hero like NTR. I wanted to see him in movies with some different concepts or at least thrillers.Temper is the one which satisfied me with the role NTR played. Puri pulled the best out of NTR. Even people who doesn't like NTR will start liking him after watching Temper.Dialogs and comedy are perfectly placed. Songs are addictive after repeated listening. BGM could be done better. Not the Puri's best but definitely one of the best movies in recent times.I have seen it 3 times and enjoyed equally every time.",5
Temper,"Daya (ntr) grows as an orphan and his only aim is to become a police officer because he believes that's the best way to exploit the world and become rich. He becomes a cop as he wishes and knowing his corruption level, he is brought to Vizag by the bad guy Waltair Vasu (Prakash Raj). Both bond very well and meanwhile Daya falls in love with Sanvi (kajal). However, she asks him for something which changes Daya's life upside down. What is that and whether he is successful or not forms the rest.The director has come up with a mass storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was quite absorbing. The dialogues were hard hitting and had good punch. The script was good but the screenplay made it lot better. The background score was excellent and all songs were worth watching and listening. Cinematography was very strong. Editing was crisp. Costumes were stylish and well designed to suit the backdrop while the art department was upto the mark. The show belonged to NTR all the way as he mesmerized in all departments, he was superb. Kajal Agarwal looks cute and did her bit as required. Prakash Raj was versatile and made his presence felt. Posani was impact creating. Madhuurima is not only pretty but also showed strong acting quotient, she has great potential. Ali, Saptagiri, Jayaprakash Reddy were good. Subbaraju was okay. Others did their bit as required.A corrupt cop becoming a good cop is a known plot but it all matters on how well the story has been weaved and the audience was engaged. This is something the director was successful in doing. The first half revolves around certain elements of humor, romance and good action sequences. The interval bang was interesting and it is the second half where the momentum picks up. The last fifteen minutes was quite engaging and thought provoking. Overall, temper which started out as a regular masala pot boiler, turns into hard hitting film post interval, the film talks about issues which plague India today like rape, and violence against women. Finally this film is a must watch for its amazing 2nd half in which the police station scene, and court room scene are highlights. Also watch it for Tarak's best performance,its a pleasure to see such amazing characterization, Jr ntr turns villain and hero. Puri take a bow,he has proved a mass film can have a heart, and a story to tell.4/5* or 8/10",4
Temper,"A simple plot narrated in typical Puri Jagannadh's style joined with powerful performance of NTR has shown good impact on the screen, not too many spoilers* ahead, despite lackluster first half the second-half of the movie had a good graph.The film resembles with an age old story and one that's quite similar to the recently released Kalyanram starrer Pataas; however, in this case, the focus is on NTR, who is at ease in his new avatar. NTR has gone through a major makeover in terms of his styling, voice modulation and his new found confidence clearly shows on screen.In the end, Temper comes as a film which was meant for NTR to reinvent himself, for Puri to showcase his style of comeback.",4
Temper,"Temper is thoroughly entertaining from start to the end. Its not just a regular popcorn entertainer, its a bold move. Temper deals with a very sensitive and controversial topic that is trending today.I went into the movie expecting it to be another formulaic Puri Jagannadh Cop story, but boy it blew my mind. The way every character binds with the story is fantastic.There is no question in saying that Tarak is arguably the best actor in Telugu film Industry and now I have whole new respect for him. In a career spanning full of stereotypical roles, this one took serious balls to do. The way he transformed from a corrupt cop to standing for a cause was very convincingly done. He killed every single second he was on the screen and specially the entire sequence in the police station gave me electrifying goosebumps.Puri Jagannadh is known for his brutal honesty and a little sarcasm when it comes to sexism, I was a little surprised that he didn't feature any of that in this film and The surprise element he introduced during the climax of the film was amazing. I didn't see that coming.I generally do not care about the songs in a movie, but i kinda liked a couple of songs in this movie. my personal favorite is the title track. Tarak nailed itThe Characters were great, performances were awesome, story was bold, screenplay was gripping and Direction was near perfect.Overall i would say Temper is one of the best Telugu films of this decade. 9/10. re watch guaranteed.",5
Temper,"Jr. NTR, the man who drives the whole movie with his terrific performance. Puri Jagannath is back with his stylish direction with much good plot and screenplay. The movie revolves around an egoistic young police officer who is corrupted and will commit anything for money and he realizes that the time has come to change his character and brings down the bad men to justice. We can see Jr. NTR in a different role which delivers an awesome performance as a negative shaded police officer deserves a big round of applause. I liked the dialogue delivery, action ( realistic action - dint find much masala in that, i would say, better than any Telugu flicks), songs were fine, Background score was pretty much good (Mani Sharma did a fantastic job for the movie). All the other main stream actors including Prakash Raj, Madhurima, Posani Krishna Murali did justice to their job. Kajal Agarwal was a mere waste in the movie .. just coming in to the screen for some romantic scenes and for songs. She looked terrible. Climax was really awesome, But the scenes in the police station (pre climax) was a let down and felt bored when he beats up the henchmen and the police yelling like POLICE was boring to an extent. I would say must watch movie, (if you are looking for a Telugu flick with Stuff and Performances). My Rating: 7.9 on 10",4
Temper,"Jr NTR is nothing less than brilliant here, as he has another feather in the cop here. It is amazing how he has managed to flourish under almost every condition that has been put before him. How effective can he be? We can never know the limits of his abilities as it seems. Posani Krishna Murali is also nothing less than the powerful and later the helpless figure that he is supposed to be - there are actors who could have easily made this character more effective. Posani fails to bloom in this character. Prakash Raj and JP are also good and the former is extremely efficient at times Kajal Aggarwal is okay and suited for the role with her looks alone, otherwise she has much less to do. Pavitra Lokesh, Madhurima and Tanikella Bharini are limited to a few minutes on the screen. Ajay and Subbaraju have very less dialogues and presence.",5
Temper,"This film is better than the awful Simmba.
Ranvir Bhavnani is an overhyped actor who cannot match NTR.",5
Temper,"When ever a film from NTR comes out, there will be a lot of expectations on that film as he is considered as one of the finest actors in contemporary Indian cinema. His last two films are not up to the mark but with this film, he is back with a bang. The film starts off with good note but starts to drop down the graph during mid first half. However, film quickly gains momentum moving into the main plot and engages the audience till the end. Second half of the film is superb with the phenomenal performance of lead actor NTR and well supported side role by Posani. Play between these two characters are written so well that these 2 characters form total crux in the main plot. Confrontation scenes between these two characters are superbly handled. Film reaches its emotional peak at the climax which is superbly elevated by a totally unexpected twist.This film is must watch for all sensible movie lovers and Indian cinema fans for the stellar performance of NTR, superb writing and Jagan's direction.PS: No need to mention about his dances. He excelled in dances in this film.",5
Temper,"Awesome movie , one of the best for NTR in his career. thanks to PURI a great story and a excellent direction. KAJOL played excellent role and PRAKASH RAJ made his ultimatum . again really fascinated towards the movie but an ultimate one finally thank to ll the team of temper. kindly for the fans and all the people don't watch in piracy.Awesome movie , one of the best for NTR in his career. thanks to PURI a great story and a excellent direction.

Temper,"First of all, I don't understand how it became the block buster and one of the highest grosser for NTR. I tried very hard to like it, but it's just a commercial movie with completely false disguise of having a moral end.The hero character in this movie is bad at first, who turns out to be good in the climax, but the character is so much evil (worst) and is not at all eligible to be idolized at the end. That's one major disgusting thing about this movie.The screenplay is such that the audience are meant to enjoy the wickedness of the hero.I had also tried to enjoy the comedy at least, but it is again just irritatingly heavy shouting, insulting and nothing delightful.I can not give this movie more than a star cause this movie only have negative impacts and nothing positive at all.The movies like Neninthe, Idiot, Amma Nanna Tamilammay etc from PJ were so good that this movie seems to be just a deceitful attempt from the director who is desperate for a hit movie and this defame his sincerity in movie making.",1
Temper,Movie is so much nice nice screenplay nice dialogues so much entertainment,5
Temper,"Dear junior NTR sir
Again a d again you are proving. You are versatile actor. In this temper movie u proved it. Your brindavan nanaku prematho .janatha garage.etc all are good.keep going",5
Temper,"GOOD:- First of all, NTR-JR is seen in a new avatar. That is something refreshing in the movie. Movie is good throughout and entertains the people well. Biggest advantage being the director's trademark dialogs which are even electrifying when delivered by the protagonist. First half is okay with healthy comedy and second half is the show stopper with excellent climax scene which makes you re-believe in the potential of the Kingpin and the protagonist. Major asset in the movie is the BGM by Manisharma and the transcendent dance moves by NTR-JR.BAD:- As my title suggests, it is a feast for fans. It might not be very pleasing for family audience as the confabulations were bit vulgar and has lots of vagueness. Romance didn't work out that well between the protagonists and that was a poor plot. Couldn't use the full potential of the comedians Ali and Ramesh, maybe the plot didn't support their appearance further. Could have used JP well and given justification for his role in the movie. One might wonder after some time, about the protagonist's new avatar as all the dialogs seems to be yelling rather than being delivered. One might think that the movie has some plots relating to Rakhi and Lakshminarasimha. (Latter might not be very descry)Verdict:- Good movie with a new avatar. I personally enjoyed the movie and is definitely a one-time watch, period.",4
Temper,"After watching temper, one can definitely say that this is Tarak one man show.Young Tiger is back with his fabulous performance.After watching the movie ""RAKHI"", if ppl liked tarak, after watching ""Temper"" ppl will love NTR because of the story line.After so many years NTR came with a film that consists of both social and commerical elements.Hatsoff to vakkantham vamshi garu for the superb story line and special thanks to puri jagannadh for making such an extraordinary movie.How can one forget about the superb role done by posani garu!!Positive Aspects: 1)NTR action, attitude,expressions 2)Puri MARK dialouges 3)TITLE SONG 4)posani acting 6)CLIMAX Negative Aspects: 1)first half was Little bit slow. 2)No comedyFinal Verdict:""Temper"" is block buster~ A must watch film !!",5
Temper,"Daya is an orphan who grows up learning that a police's life is a happy one with lots of money coming in the form of bribes which inspires him to become a police officer. After years, he becomes a corrupt, cunning, manipulative and ruthless sub inspector of police. He is transferred to Visakhapatnam where he forms an immediate friendship with the local don Waltair Vasu by releasing his four brothers Ravi, Mani, Varun and Sundeep from the jail who were arrested for smuggling. Daya's attitude does not go well with his subordinate Narayana Murthy, a sincere police constable. In vain, he tries to oppose Daya's deeds.",5
Temper,Loved the story line and the way NTR Jr carried his attitude as Dhana.,5
Temper,"My review may seem clichd but just expressing what I felt after watching this movie. The movie is briefly about a 100% cunning and criminal minded police officer who teams up with a local and feared gangster. Soon after an incident, Daya changes into a very honest officer. He now goes against Prakash Raj. What happens after this is to be seen. Till this point, the movie is quite normal and is like typical Telugu movie in Puri Jagan's style. The second half does much better and at the end, this film is a thought provoking. Story may be old but is still powerful. Puri's direction is super and NTR's characterization is at peaks. NTR's best comes in this movie and his performance will be lapped up by both masses and class audiences. Overall, it's awesome.",4
Temper,But what can you expect from South. Instead watch Simmba.,1
H2O,"Though I should be embarrassed to say that at 18 I watch a television show marketed for tweens, I'm not. H2O: Just Add Water is quality entertainment.The storyline, though not entirely lacking in plot holes, is well thought out and attention catching. I've scoured the internet on more than one occasion in the attempts of finding the next episodes and I'm mildly heartbroken about the current state of Season 3. I cannot help but remain interested in whatever might be happening in ""mermaid land"" The acting is certainly not that of Kate Winslet or George Clooney but as far as the small screen goes the skills of the young cast are enviable. Phoebe Tonkin (Cleo), Cariba Heine (Rikki), and Claire Holt (Emma) are the three headliners. They portray their roles as not only mermaids but best friends in a believable and touching way--and manage to convey turmoil in their relationships with each other but significant others as well. We often see Angus McLaren (Lewis) and Burgess Abernethy (Zane) throughout the series and they too are welcome characters.

I have only seen 6 episodes. Because i missed it on channel ten so i am now watching it on the Disney channel. So if you are looking a the show and thinking is this a good show. i would say to you no... Its a GREAT show. And i would definitely recommend you watch it.",5
H2O,"This is not just a kids show. One of the biggest reasons I love this show so much is because it involves relationships, friendships, heartache in great depth yet includes no foul language or anything of that sort. The show is well developed from season to season as well as the characters. Some of the quotes are pure genius (if you watch it you will see what I mean) there are some hilarious one-liners and scenes in the show as well as some serious moments, gripping moments, and moments that have made me laugh out loud and cry. The cast is amazing and perfect for their parts - which is pretty rare. The casts acting improves as the seasons go on and the episodes always have me at the edge of my seat. Brilliant, stunning, 10/10.",5
H2O,"This show has some of the best developed character personalities I have ever seen.If you like shows aimed at pre teens to teens then you will most likely love this show.The start of the show is kind of confusing but if you keep watching it gets better and better! The plot of the show revolves around three teenage girls that get turned into mermaids.Also how they deal with everyday situations with there new found 'abilities'.I recommend this show to anyone that likes relationships,mermaids,and just watching one of the best shows ever!.It really is that good, and you will not regret watching it.",5
H2O,"This is the BEST new show I've seen in many years, and I've been watching television since 1966. The effects are superb, the actors are both very attractive and very talented. And the Australian accents make it all the more adorable. ""MERMAID"" just sounds SO much better when it rolls off the tongue of a beautiful Australian actress. You have to watch this show from the start, and give it until season 2 to really hit its stride. It gets very humorous in season 2 - truly a joy to watch. Great for all ages - trust me on this one - i know my mermaids! If this show had an advertising budget behind it it would have been a super smash. Oh and yes I agree - the music is also excellent especially the theme song NO ORDINARY GIRL. I just LOVE this show! If you only watch ONE EPISODE - be sure its SEASON 2 episode 15 IRRESISTIBLE. This is by far the funniest of all the episodes, some of the humor will be lost on you if you haven't seen the prior shows, but it can stand on its own just fine. I'm off to roll around in some ambergris and shamelessly throw myself at the cast...",5
H2O,"Quick and easy: 3 Aussie girls Cleo, Emma & Ricki,(all with opposing personalities, for some added tension whenever it suits) get stuck on a boat, land on an island and their only way back is through magic water. From then on whenever water touches their skin, they immediately turn into mermaids, just like the series title connotes. Life is then a very strange journey for the girls and their time to accept their new powers concerning water. There's the nerdy side kick 'Lewis', a young scientist and trusty friend and Miriam the class bitch who's nasty comments just show her immature personality. Tweens will love the show, but anyone over 13 will recognize the Friday afternoon time slot and the ""kid type"" plots that come along with it. However it is good to see some Australian shows on our screens.",3
H2O,"*********May contain spoiler*************I am 15 and I have to say I love this show! It is about 3 teenage girls: Rikki, Cleo and Emma who, when accidentally stumbling across the mysterious Maego Island, find they now develop tails every time they come in contact with water! Not only that but they have special powers to do with the water: Rikki can boil water, Cleo can manipulate water and Emma can freeze it. When their slightly geeky friend, Lewis, discovers their powers at a pool party he helps the girls hide their secret from their family, friends and enemies in the form of stuck up rich girl Miriam and bad boy Zane whilst also helping to work out how and why they got their powers. Some of the acting could use some brushing up (Cleo's little sister Kim has an annoying way of delivering her lines) but the three main girls are brilliant, especially Rikki (Cariba Heine) who comes out with the best lines in the series and is the best new talent in Australia. The directing is really good and the underwater scenes are so cool especially the tails! All those who say that this show is just for the younger generation are wrong: the show tackles the teenage problems of boys, parties and fitting in. Those who say it's childish are just hiding the fact that they love it! If you are a fan of The Little Mermaid or maybe the lesser brilliant version of it, Aquamarine, then watch this series!",5
H2O,"I was just channel surfing and my digital box summary for the show read (almost exactly)""The story of three Australian teens that are able to transform into crime-fighting mermaids"".- Crime-fighting mermaids? It sounded like a lame, animated, 7-year-old, kiddie, ""Totally-Spies"" copy television show. So I waited for the commercial break to be over while I was reading the show info. When the show came back, I started watching it. It was the pilot episode (I guess it was the premiere of the show on the channel). It was actually REALLY good. As soon as the episode was over, immediately went on youtube to see if anyone had posted some episodes.-I was NOT gonna wait once a week to watch the show. I started to watch more on youtube and it was entertaining along with interesting plot lines in each episode. This show may sound like a girly-bad acting show, but it isn't. The other great thing about the show is that the girls have almost no acting experience on television, yet their acting is believable not overdone at all.All the special effects look totally realistic, unlike other shows for teens. Even though I've only seen at least a total of 9 episodes (from both seasons), I strongly recommend this show! I'm not exactly a fan of adventure and fantasy, but I can't stop watching ""H2O: Just Add Water""!GO RIKKI, EMMA, AND CLEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 9/10",5
H2O,"One of my friends recommended this show to me, and once I saw the first episode, I didn't really know what to think.The story starts off with Cleo being the main focus, and jumping right into her life, with her friends, enemies and family.Who are the people she is talking to? The story starts off slow, and if you are only planning on seeing the first episode, steer away right now. The characters' backgrounds and personalities are built up over the first few episodes, along with how they can cope with what is happening to them, but you have to stick with it or it won't make any sense.Cleo is talking to this girl who is swimming, Emma. Emma is an important character int he story, as without her I am sure Cleo and Rikki would have been goners from the start.So, we meet Rikki, who stole something off someone's boat (Note to self : watch my wallet around her), and valiantly jumps into the boat she stole the item from, which Cleo is now in. Now, my first impression of Rikki: Loud mouthed and cheeky. It turns out I wasn't that far off, but, in the end, it makes the show all the better. The 3 girls' personalities even out over the episodes.And well, we have the main characters: Emma, the cautious one, Rikki, the one in-your-face one, and Cleo, the . . . I am not really sure how to describe her. Off the top of my head I would say 'annoying', but I think there are depths to her personality that I keep overlooking.Then there is Lewis. Having known Cleo for who knows how long, he is seen often, as more of a comic relief character who thinks he is a scientist, and is usually, if not asking the girls for hair samples, trying to figure out what is up with them.All in all, I would say this is a great, fun show. The plot is, in fact, thicker than I would have thought possible from watching the first episode (So stick to it!). It has a great assortment of characters (though, I do think a few skip between in and out of character), and plot twists when you least expect it (or think nothing else can go wrong for the three). So, I give this show 8/10 rating, for a great plot, good humor, and episodes that you want to see at least twice.",4
H2O,"OK so i saw the add 4 this show on nick the other day and thought it would be another ""sleepover club"" type show (well it is) but found it was much better than i tought the sleepover club just got annoying 3 girls Rikki Cleo and Emma stumble upon an ancient cavern they undergo a transformation when they touch water they become mermaids they also have power like Rikki can boil water Cleo can morph and Emma can freeze waterthey have to hide their powers and trying do normal stuff which in fairness would be kinda hard if every time u touch water u turn into a mermaid!!! there friend lewis found out and is helping them.i think the show is good if ur a girl and under 13 u defiantly love it it's got that cute childish charm to it but still if ur over 13 u might like it too it's got that teen drama thing too which is always amusing i think it's funny and i'm a good bit over 13 still it might get boring i've only watched 4 episodes",5
H2O,"this show is great great effects for a low budget show. stunning underwater photography and amazingly realistic tails make this one of the greatest mermaid media ever created. the show however is not so popular in the us but its incredible popular though out the world showing in over 140 countries/territories and over 200 million viewers of the show a week making huge. with the demand for a new season, a new season will start this October. the beginning is a little bad by not so good acting but good enough and then over a short time they get they're acting great. the show has a lot of twists in the tail(laugh out loud) making it one of my favorite shows ever. i highly recommend this show to anyone who likes magic mermaids for all ages",5
H2O,"As a response to the previous comment...The show is shown in America,as of recently, and it is shown on Teen Nick on weekends.Right now I am watching an episode about Emma having a sleepover, and it is good. I am 14, and I saw it for the first time yesterday. The girls I babysit, 11 and 7, enjoy it immensely, I think mainly for the mermaids. So far I guess it is okay. It just seems like another teen sitcom. A guy gets in the way of all of the girls and they get mad. I think it is interesting how it takes 10 seconds after they get wet. Cleo just got wet and turned into a mermaid in front of the party. That was an interesting plot turn. Oh well. Watch the show and find out if you like it!",5
H2O,"i absolutely love this show and i am over 13 i admit it!! but i also admit i am a mermaid lover so it goes together i believe. i saw all the episodes and i cant wait for season 2 to begin. the 2 last episodes were so good,i must say if season 2 is as good as the 2 last,it will be hot.so as i say i am a mermaid lover and the underwater scene are so beautiful. the tails are amazing, i think they look like the tail in the up coming movie fishtale. i must say this show made me think of the TV movie mermaids. for those who don't know what it is, its the story of 3 sisters who are mermaids and comes to live on land and they each have a power, like h20; but its was an adult movie. h20 is more for teens and ...well, like i said for mermaid lover!!!",5
H2O,"H20 is a programme about three girls, Rikki, Emma and Cleo, who discover that when they go into water or get water on them , they turn into mermaids. Even though today's episode was only the fourth episode they have shown in England, I still love this programme.Oh, and in America, do they show this on Disney Channel? Because over here in London they show this on NickelodeonPlease could somebody answer my question because I am desperate to know Thank You P.S. I can't believe the actress that plays Rikki is from South Africa",5
H2O,"The first series revolves around Emma Gilbert, Cleo Sertori and Rikki Chadwick, who are given the power to turn into mermaids when water touches there skin. They discover their amazing powers over water - Cleo can control the shape and volume of water, Emma can freeze it, and Rikki can boil it. Lewis McCartney, a friend of Cleo - helps them from being exposed. These series is mostly about Rikki, Emma and Cleo learning to use their powers and dealing with everyday problems, such as pesky siblings. Cleo meets an old lady, Louise Chatham, who was a mermaid in her past and who warns her, Emma and Rikki from the full moon. They have to be careful because people are trying to expose them like Zane Bennett(the Bad boy)when he was trapped on a sinking boat and Emma has to save him. Zane sees a half of her tail and looks everywhere near Mako Island for the ""sea monster"". later he and rikki date. I would recommend this show to anyone.",5
H2O,"It struck me while watching. These girls are frantic about being discovered as mermaids and then becoming subjects for scientific research. While there would have been a big fuss made, just think about it... mermaids. They'd be ideal candidates for the National Sea Rescue Institute. They'd have made their parents proud. They'd be revered wherever they'd go. After all, this is the Twenty-FIrst Century. They'd be on every talk show and every magazine cover, living in the lap of luxury. Yet they are hiding. Come on, they're bright, they'd have figured this out!Let me just thank Claire Holt, Phoebe Tonkin, Cariba Heine, new girl Indiana Evans and, yes, not forgetting Cleo Massey, wonderful, wonderful show, amazing... Something done on a small scale (compared to Hollywood, that is) but which comes out as much much more than the sum of its parts.",5
H2O,Embarrassed to say that I'm 17 years old and still love this series! I've probably watched it 4 times now! It's just so good and there's something new and great in each episode!! Also if you have watched it then you'll know Zane and Ricki are just the cutest couple but I would say it gets bad in season 3 because Emma leaves so my 10 star rating is for seasons 1 and 2 and I'd give 7-8 for season 3 :),5
H2O,"I saw this series in the last year and I absolutely loved it. As a whole, it was well done and it did its job in entertaining me. However, there were five things that irked me throughout the series: 1. Kim. Okay, yes, she's supposed to be the annoying younger sibling character, but she NEVER got disciplined for mouthing off to her parents. If I had said or done half of the things this girl did while I was growing up, I would've been either spanked or grounded. 2. Will in season 3. For the most part, I have no problem with him. He reminded me a bit of Byron from S1: a genuinely nice guy. However, what I had an issue with was the girls looking to Will and suddenly treating him like the expert in all things mermaid after finding out Bella (the mermaid who replaced Emma in S3) was a mermaid when Zane had known about them for two years. 3. Cleo: Her whole personality changes in S3 and she becomes a cross between Lewis and Emma, which made no sense. I could see her becoming more confident after the fiasco with Charlotte but to suddenly change her personality so much? 4. Bella's appearance:. Bella herself is an interesting character, but Cleo and Rikki were awful quick to welcome her into their group after everything with Charlotte.
Why weren't they more suspicious? 5. The water tentacle/comet angle: honestly I wasn't a fan of this angle as it made it feel like a whole different show. However, these flaws don't take away from my enjoyment. The series is wonderful and I enjoyed every character even the villains.",5
H2O,"I used to watch this while it was still being aired on TV and then when I realized it was Netflix, I was super excited!! I literally have re-watched this series like once every summer for 4 years! If you love mermaids, and don't mind high school drama, YOU WILL LOVE THIS SHOW. I will say that I do love the original 3 girls and not the new ones that replace the old.",5
H2O,"I have no idea what the chick from the USA was on about just because it's not American humour dosen't mean its not a great show, newsflash the rest of the world dosen't have to like everything you like.The show has a fan base with yes unbelievable story lines and love interests, Love how all the girls are settling into their characters and each seem to be finding their own ways.If you like the movie aquamarine and like shows that don't take themselves too serious than this show is for you. Look out for Indianna Evans from Home and Away when she joins the cast for season 3.My advice watch a few eps and if you don't like it don't like it don't watch anymore.",5
H2O,"OK i know i am an old lady and am forced to watch these things with granddaughter. I watched Mako first and we both enjoyed it i quite liked it did a review. Then we decided to watch H20 just add water. I found it quite tedious and lacked any substance, i mean they transform into mermaids and must avoid the moon, but every time it comes up they always allow someone to open their door so the moon light comes in, and one will be affected and off they go in a trance...yawn. Then the not getting wet or turn into a fish, yes always they get wet and one turns into a fish. I mean Cleo gets a job with dolphins really. Then they freeze someone in the cafes freezer i mean she was solid, and stuck in there all night, and they defrost her with their special powers and she wakes up as though nothing happened, REALLY....i just sighed and thought how stupid is this. Then boo hiss we have way too many nasty females, Kim Cleos sister who is a brat all through the series, Sophie Wills sister horrible person really, then Charlotte who turns into a nasty horrible mermaid and does really bad things to the girls, but all is forgiven yawn. Even Sophie who causes the island magic pool to collapse seems to be forgiven yawn again. So many silly things, I mean i know its for young people it had its moments but it was just well the same thing over and over again. The best person was Lewis who left, I couldn't get on with Rikki and Emma left and we had Bella who was yes a mermaid but from Ireland. All the things that happened and no one even made a comment or wondered why. How can you keep that kind of thing a secret, i mean water is everywhere in our lives. Oh and what a hoot tentacles really they looked like snakes or eels to me. Oh and no way would a comet be allowed to get so close it would breach our atmosphere. Far fetched or what lol. Oh and really snorkelling under the sea give me a break how bad is that. No i preferred Mako it had more substance and story line. I can see the charm of it for young people but even my grand daughter found it hard work.",3
H2O,"I used to watch this show as a kid and I loved it. The effects were good and are still decent today, the tails were beautifully designed if you watch the behind the scenes videos. However, the characters didn't seem all that realistic, the acting was decent but I'll give it credit for covering important subjects like animal abuse with illegal fishing of sea turtles etc. This show does have some substance and morals that are interesting but besides that it's dull. The underwater scenes are beautiful to look at, although there are some aspects that I just can't overlook. First of all the title is incredibly stupid. H20 just add water doesn't make any sense, if you replace H20 with water, the title literally means water just add water! H20 is just the chemical name for water which is made up of two hydrogens and 1 oxygen= water. There are a few plot holes and stupid moments that make no semblance of sense. ( spoiler alert) How Lewis first tests the water inside of the girl's DNA. It is not scientifically possible for a person to have a mermaid's tail just by swimming in a ""moon pool"" there has to be an already existing genetic material from some line of lineage. So, he should've tested the girl's DNA first and then the water to see what activated the genetics. They do explain some of this when Charlotte shows up in season 2-3 but besides that it should've been obvious. It is an enjoyable show for kids but lacks in certain parts.",3
H2O,"The Best Show Ever H2o Just Add water is the best Australian TV Show I've ever seen.The acting,the plot,the place and storyline are incredible.The Girls have some amazing magic powers,which an ordinary Girl can only dream of.To me,Emma has the most amazing power and I think that she shouldn't be replaced by Indiana Evans.That would be very sad to all Emma real fans.And the girls have got a lots of enemies:Charlotte,the evil mermaid,Zane,the rich boy,Denman,the marine biologist and Miriam,the stacked up rich girl,which they can fight with their powers.I think that H2o Just Add Water is the best show I've seen and it is suitable to children to all ages.Also,my opinion is that there should be more shows like that,that do not involve sex,nudity,stupid scenes,violence and etc.I just can't wait for season 3!The only bad thing about the upcoming season is the fact that Emma won't be there and she'll be replaced by the stupid Bella.Also,That show has some outstanding music.I love all Kate Alexa's No Ordinary Girl,which is played at the beginning of the episodes and Feel it Too,which is played at the episode when Kim and Eliott go on a date,it's good music.",5

After they walk for a little bit they find a little pool which if they swim underwater would lead them out to the sea. When they get into water they find that the water starts bubbling and sparkling. They don't think anything of it and swim to safety. The next day the girls realize that they have tuned into mermaids. They decide not to tell anyone because they were scared they would end up in a freak show. Later on they find that they have powers over water. Rikki can boil it, Cleo can morph it and Emma can freeze it. While tyring to keep this secret but not let in ruin the lives Cleo decides to go to a party where Zane (The bad boy) throws her in the water while everybody goes inside Lewis (Cleo friends who she likes and he likes her two)is shocked to see her turn into a mermaid he helps and finds out that Emma and Rikki are mermaids to. I have only seen 6 episodes. Because i missed it on channel ten so i am now watching it on the Disney channel. So if you are looking a the show and thinking is this a good show. i would say to you no... Its a GREAT show. And i would definitely recommend you watch it.",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"This is not just a kids show. One of the biggest reasons I love this show so much is because it involves relationships, friendships, heartache in great depth yet includes no foul language or anything of that sort. The show is well developed from season to season as well as the characters. Some of the quotes are pure genius (if you watch it you will see what I mean) there are some hilarious one-liners and scenes in the show as well as some serious moments, gripping moments, and moments that have made me laugh out loud and cry. The cast is amazing and perfect for their parts - which is pretty rare. The casts acting improves as the seasons go on and the episodes always have me at the edge of my seat. Brilliant, stunning, 10/10.",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"This show has some of the best developed character personalities I have ever seen.If you like shows aimed at pre teens to teens then you will most likely love this show.The start of the show is kind of confusing but if you keep watching it gets better and better! The plot of the show revolves around three teenage girls that get turned into mermaids.Also how they deal with everyday situations with there new found 'abilities'.I recommend this show to anyone that likes relationships,mermaids,and just watching one of the best shows ever!.It really is that good, and you will not regret watching it.",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"This is the BEST new show I've seen in many years, and I've been watching television since 1966. The effects are superb, the actors are both very attractive and very talented. And the Australian accents make it all the more adorable. ""MERMAID"" just sounds SO much better when it rolls off the tongue of a beautiful Australian actress. You have to watch this show from the start, and give it until season 2 to really hit its stride. It gets very humorous in season 2 - truly a joy to watch. Great for all ages - trust me on this one - i know my mermaids! If this show had an advertising budget behind it it would have been a super smash. Oh and yes I agree - the music is also excellent especially the theme song NO ORDINARY GIRL. I just LOVE this show! If you only watch ONE EPISODE - be sure its SEASON 2 episode 15 IRRESISTIBLE. This is by far the funniest of all the episodes, some of the humor will be lost on you if you haven't seen the prior shows, but it can stand on its own just fine. I'm off to roll around in some ambergris and shamelessly throw myself at the cast...",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"Quick and easy: 3 Aussie girls Cleo, Emma & Ricki,(all with opposing personalities, for some added tension whenever it suits) get stuck on a boat, land on an island and their only way back is through magic water. From then on whenever water touches their skin, they immediately turn into mermaids, just like the series title connotes. Life is then a very strange journey for the girls and their time to accept their new powers concerning water. There's the nerdy side kick 'Lewis', a young scientist and trusty friend and Miriam the class bitch who's nasty comments just show her immature personality. Tweens will love the show, but anyone over 13 will recognize the Friday afternoon time slot and the ""kid type"" plots that come along with it. However it is good to see some Australian shows on our screens.",3
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"*********May contain spoiler*************I am 15 and I have to say I love this show! It is about 3 teenage girls: Rikki, Cleo and Emma who, when accidentally stumbling across the mysterious Maego Island, find they now develop tails every time they come in contact with water! Not only that but they have special powers to do with the water: Rikki can boil water, Cleo can manipulate water and Emma can freeze it. When their slightly geeky friend, Lewis, discovers their powers at a pool party he helps the girls hide their secret from their family, friends and enemies in the form of stuck up rich girl Miriam and bad boy Zane whilst also helping to work out how and why they got their powers. Some of the acting could use some brushing up (Cleo's little sister Kim has an annoying way of delivering her lines) but the three main girls are brilliant, especially Rikki (Cariba Heine) who comes out with the best lines in the series and is the best new talent in Australia. The directing is really good and the underwater scenes are so cool especially the tails! All those who say that this show is just for the younger generation are wrong: the show tackles the teenage problems of boys, parties and fitting in. Those who say it's childish are just hiding the fact that they love it! If you are a fan of The Little Mermaid or maybe the lesser brilliant version of it, Aquamarine, then watch this series!",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"I was just channel surfing and my digital box summary for the show read (almost exactly)""The story of three Australian teens that are able to transform into crime-fighting mermaids"".- Crime-fighting mermaids? It sounded like a lame, animated, 7-year-old, kiddie, ""Totally-Spies"" copy television show. So I waited for the commercial break to be over while I was reading the show info. When the show came back, I started watching it. It was the pilot episode (I guess it was the premiere of the show on the channel). It was actually REALLY good. As soon as the episode was over, immediately went on youtube to see if anyone had posted some episodes.-I was NOT gonna wait once a week to watch the show. I started to watch more on youtube and it was entertaining along with interesting plot lines in each episode. This show may sound like a girly-bad acting show, but it isn't. The other great thing about the show is that the girls have almost no acting experience on television, yet their acting is believable not overdone at all.All the special effects look totally realistic, unlike other shows for teens. Even though I've only seen at least a total of 9 episodes (from both seasons), I strongly recommend this show! I'm not exactly a fan of adventure and fantasy, but I can't stop watching ""H2O: Just Add Water""!GO RIKKI, EMMA, AND CLEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 9/10",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"One of my friends recommended this show to me, and once I saw the first episode, I didn't really know what to think.The story starts off with Cleo being the main focus, and jumping right into her life, with her friends, enemies and family.Who are the people she is talking to? The story starts off slow, and if you are only planning on seeing the first episode, steer away right now. The characters' backgrounds and personalities are built up over the first few episodes, along with how they can cope with what is happening to them, but you have to stick with it or it won't make any sense.Cleo is talking to this girl who is swimming, Emma. Emma is an important character int he story, as without her I am sure Cleo and Rikki would have been goners from the start.So, we meet Rikki, who stole something off someone's boat (Note to self : watch my wallet around her), and valiantly jumps into the boat she stole the item from, which Cleo is now in. Now, my first impression of Rikki: Loud mouthed and cheeky. It turns out I wasn't that far off, but, in the end, it makes the show all the better. The 3 girls' personalities even out over the episodes.And well, we have the main characters: Emma, the cautious one, Rikki, the one in-your-face one, and Cleo, the . . . I am not really sure how to describe her. Off the top of my head I would say 'annoying', but I think there are depths to her personality that I keep overlooking.Then there is Lewis. Having known Cleo for who knows how long, he is seen often, as more of a comic relief character who thinks he is a scientist, and is usually, if not asking the girls for hair samples, trying to figure out what is up with them.All in all, I would say this is a great, fun show. The plot is, in fact, thicker than I would have thought possible from watching the first episode (So stick to it!). It has a great assortment of characters (though, I do think a few skip between in and out of character), and plot twists when you least expect it (or think nothing else can go wrong for the three). So, I give this show 8/10 rating, for a great plot, good humor, and episodes that you want to see at least twice.",4
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"OK so i saw the add 4 this show on nick the other day and thought it would be another ""sleepover club"" type show (well it is) but found it was much better than i tought the sleepover club just got annoying 3 girls Rikki Cleo and Emma stumble upon an ancient cavern they undergo a transformation when they touch water they become mermaids they also have power like Rikki can boil water Cleo can morph and Emma can freeze waterthey have to hide their powers and trying do normal stuff which in fairness would be kinda hard if every time u touch water u turn into a mermaid!!! there friend lewis found out and is helping them.i think the show is good if ur a girl and under 13 u defiantly love it it's got that cute childish charm to it but still if ur over 13 u might like it too it's got that teen drama thing too which is always amusing i think it's funny and i'm a good bit over 13 still it might get boring i've only watched 4 episodes",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"this show is great great effects for a low budget show. stunning underwater photography and amazingly realistic tails make this one of the greatest mermaid media ever created. the show however is not so popular in the us but its incredible popular though out the world showing in over 140 countries/territories and over 200 million viewers of the show a week making huge. with the demand for a new season, a new season will start this October. the beginning is a little bad by not so good acting but good enough and then over a short time they get they're acting great. the show has a lot of twists in the tail(laugh out loud) making it one of my favorite shows ever. i highly recommend this show to anyone who likes magic mermaids for all ages",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"As a response to the previous comment...The show is shown in America,as of recently, and it is shown on Teen Nick on weekends.Right now I am watching an episode about Emma having a sleepover, and it is good. I am 14, and I saw it for the first time yesterday. The girls I babysit, 11 and 7, enjoy it immensely, I think mainly for the mermaids. So far I guess it is okay. It just seems like another teen sitcom. A guy gets in the way of all of the girls and they get mad. I think it is interesting how it takes 10 seconds after they get wet. Cleo just got wet and turned into a mermaid in front of the party. That was an interesting plot turn. Oh well. Watch the show and find out if you like it!",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"i absolutely love this show and i am over 13 i admit it!! but i also admit i am a mermaid lover so it goes together i believe. i saw all the episodes and i cant wait for season 2 to begin. the 2 last episodes were so good,i must say if season 2 is as good as the 2 last,it will be hot.so as i say i am a mermaid lover and the underwater scene are so beautiful. the tails are amazing, i think they look like the tail in the up coming movie fishtale. i must say this show made me think of the TV movie mermaids. for those who don't know what it is, its the story of 3 sisters who are mermaids and comes to live on land and they each have a power, like h20; but its was an adult movie. h20 is more for teens and ...well, like i said for mermaid lover!!!",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"H20 is a programme about three girls, Rikki, Emma and Cleo, who discover that when they go into water or get water on them , they turn into mermaids. Even though today's episode was only the fourth episode they have shown in England, I still love this programme.Oh, and in America, do they show this on Disney Channel? Because over here in London they show this on NickelodeonPlease could somebody answer my question because I am desperate to know Thank You P.S. I can't believe the actress that plays Rikki is from South Africa",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"The first series revolves around Emma Gilbert, Cleo Sertori and Rikki Chadwick, who are given the power to turn into mermaids when water touches there skin. They discover their amazing powers over water - Cleo can control the shape and volume of water, Emma can freeze it, and Rikki can boil it. Lewis McCartney, a friend of Cleo - helps them from being exposed. These series is mostly about Rikki, Emma and Cleo learning to use their powers and dealing with everyday problems, such as pesky siblings. Cleo meets an old lady, Louise Chatham, who was a mermaid in her past and who warns her, Emma and Rikki from the full moon. They have to be careful because people are trying to expose them like Zane Bennett(the Bad boy)when he was trapped on a sinking boat and Emma has to save him. Zane sees a half of her tail and looks everywhere near Mako Island for the ""sea monster"". later he and rikki date. I would recommend this show to anyone.",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"It struck me while watching. These girls are frantic about being discovered as mermaids and then becoming subjects for scientific research. While there would have been a big fuss made, just think about it... mermaids. They'd be ideal candidates for the National Sea Rescue Institute. They'd have made their parents proud. They'd be revered wherever they'd go. After all, this is the Twenty-FIrst Century. They'd be on every talk show and every magazine cover, living in the lap of luxury. Yet they are hiding. Come on, they're bright, they'd have figured this out!Let me just thank Claire Holt, Phoebe Tonkin, Cariba Heine, new girl Indiana Evans and, yes, not forgetting Cleo Massey, wonderful, wonderful show, amazing... Something done on a small scale (compared to Hollywood, that is) but which comes out as much much more than the sum of its parts.",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,Embarrassed to say that I'm 17 years old and still love this series! I've probably watched it 4 times now! It's just so good and there's something new and great in each episode!! Also if you have watched it then you'll know Zane and Ricki are just the cutest couple but I would say it gets bad in season 3 because Emma leaves so my 10 star rating is for seasons 1 and 2 and I'd give 7-8 for season 3 :),5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"I saw this series in the last year and I absolutely loved it. As a whole, it was well done and it did its job in entertaining me. However, there were five things that irked me throughout the series: 1. Kim. Okay, yes, she's supposed to be the annoying younger sibling character, but she NEVER got disciplined for mouthing off to her parents. If I had said or done half of the things this girl did while I was growing up, I would've been either spanked or grounded. 2. Will in season 3. For the most part, I have no problem with him. He reminded me a bit of Byron from S1: a genuinely nice guy. However, what I had an issue with was the girls looking to Will and suddenly treating him like the expert in all things mermaid after finding out Bella (the mermaid who replaced Emma in S3) was a mermaid when Zane had known about them for two years. 3. Cleo: Her whole personality changes in S3 and she becomes a cross between Lewis and Emma, which made no sense. I could see her becoming more confident after the fiasco with Charlotte but to suddenly change her personality so much? 4. Bella's appearance:. Bella herself is an interesting character, but Cleo and Rikki were awful quick to welcome her into their group after everything with Charlotte.
Why weren't they more suspicious? 5. The water tentacle/comet angle: honestly I wasn't a fan of this angle as it made it feel like a whole different show. However, these flaws don't take away from my enjoyment. The series is wonderful and I enjoyed every character even the villains.",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"I used to watch this while it was still being aired on TV and then when I realized it was Netflix, I was super excited!! I literally have re-watched this series like once every summer for 4 years! If you love mermaids, and don't mind high school drama, YOU WILL LOVE THIS SHOW. I will say that I do love the original 3 girls and not the new ones that replace the old.",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"I have no idea what the chick from the USA was on about just because it's not American humour dosen't mean its not a great show, newsflash the rest of the world dosen't have to like everything you like.The show has a fan base with yes unbelievable story lines and love interests, Love how all the girls are settling into their characters and each seem to be finding their own ways.If you like the movie aquamarine and like shows that don't take themselves too serious than this show is for you. Look out for Indianna Evans from Home and Away when she joins the cast for season 3.My advice watch a few eps and if you don't like it don't like it don't watch anymore.",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"OK i know i am an old lady and am forced to watch these things with granddaughter. I watched Mako first and we both enjoyed it i quite liked it did a review. Then we decided to watch H20 just add water. I found it quite tedious and lacked any substance, i mean they transform into mermaids and must avoid the moon, but every time it comes up they always allow someone to open their door so the moon light comes in, and one will be affected and off they go in a trance...yawn. Then the not getting wet or turn into a fish, yes always they get wet and one turns into a fish. I mean Cleo gets a job with dolphins really. Then they freeze someone in the cafes freezer i mean she was solid, and stuck in there all night, and they defrost her with their special powers and she wakes up as though nothing happened, REALLY....i just sighed and thought how stupid is this. Then boo hiss we have way too many nasty females, Kim Cleos sister who is a brat all through the series, Sophie Wills sister horrible person really, then Charlotte who turns into a nasty horrible mermaid and does really bad things to the girls, but all is forgiven yawn. Even Sophie who causes the island magic pool to collapse seems to be forgiven yawn again. So many silly things, I mean i know its for young people it had its moments but it was just well the same thing over and over again. The best person was Lewis who left, I couldn't get on with Rikki and Emma left and we had Bella who was yes a mermaid but from Ireland. All the things that happened and no one even made a comment or wondered why. How can you keep that kind of thing a secret, i mean water is everywhere in our lives. Oh and what a hoot tentacles really they looked like snakes or eels to me. Oh and no way would a comet be allowed to get so close it would breach our atmosphere. Far fetched or what lol. Oh and really snorkelling under the sea give me a break how bad is that. No i preferred Mako it had more substance and story line. I can see the charm of it for young people but even my grand daughter found it hard work.",3
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"I used to watch this show as a kid and I loved it. The effects were good and are still decent today, the tails were beautifully designed if you watch the behind the scenes videos. However, the characters didn't seem all that realistic, the acting was decent but I'll give it credit for covering important subjects like animal abuse with illegal fishing of sea turtles etc. This show does have some substance and morals that are interesting but besides that it's dull. The underwater scenes are beautiful to look at, although there are some aspects that I just can't overlook. First of all the title is incredibly stupid. H20 just add water doesn't make any sense, if you replace H20 with water, the title literally means water just add water! H20 is just the chemical name for water which is made up of two hydrogens and 1 oxygen= water. There are a few plot holes and stupid moments that make no semblance of sense. ( spoiler alert) How Lewis first tests the water inside of the girl's DNA. It is not scientifically possible for a person to have a mermaid's tail just by swimming in a ""moon pool"" there has to be an already existing genetic material from some line of lineage. So, he should've tested the girl's DNA first and then the water to see what activated the genetics. They do explain some of this when Charlotte shows up in season 2-3 but besides that it should've been obvious. It is an enjoyable show for kids but lacks in certain parts.",3
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"The Best Show Ever H2o Just Add water is the best Australian TV Show I've ever seen.The acting,the plot,the place and storyline are incredible.The Girls have some amazing magic powers,which an ordinary Girl can only dream of.To me,Emma has the most amazing power and I think that she shouldn't be replaced by Indiana Evans.That would be very sad to all Emma real fans.And the girls have got a lots of enemies:Charlotte,the evil mermaid,Zane,the rich boy,Denman,the marine biologist and Miriam,the stacked up rich girl,which they can fight with their powers.I think that H2o Just Add Water is the best show I've seen and it is suitable to children to all ages.Also,my opinion is that there should be more shows like that,that do not involve sex,nudity,stupid scenes,violence and etc.I just can't wait for season 3!The only bad thing about the upcoming season is the fact that Emma won't be there and she'll be replaced by the stupid Bella.Also,That show has some outstanding music.I love all Kate Alexa's No Ordinary Girl,which is played at the beginning of the episodes and Feel it Too,which is played at the episode when Kim and Eliott go on a date,it's good music.",5
Ek Haqiqat Ganga,"They do not think what it is, and swim to safety. The next day, the girls realize that they have adjusted to the mermaid. They decided not to tell anyone, because they are afraid they will end in a freak show. Later, they found that they had the power of water. Ricky boil, Creole can be turned and Emma back-acting is certainly not Kate Winslet or George Clooney, but the small screen as much as possible to the young actor to skills enviable.The guidance really good, can freeze the underwater scene is so cool, especially the tail! All of these people say, this program tackles teenage boy, the younger generation of error: Displays the parties to the problem and renovated in. http://www.diablo3gold-sale.com/",5
Natpe Thunai,"Nice entertainer to watch.
Appreciating team for choosing national sport to film the drama..
Overall,Natpe thunai, a complete combo of politics and sports.",3
Natpe Thunai,Such an extraordinary intermission block at an un expected moment . Created goosebumps,5
Natpe Thunai,One of the must watch Sport Entertainer with Real Time Politics(Sports Politics)A very common starting with Fun & Love and slowly gearing up with Sports Politics. Till interval the Plot focused on Hero & His Love and First Half end up with movie's main plot Intro.Interval Block is Amazing. And there itself story gearing up with Top Speed... And Predictable movie end but still engage the Audience with the plot. Just like Director Sundar.C style(Producer of the Movie).Team's work is really good in Hockey Game's detailing in the movie and Technically very strong in Camera which is a must required thing in a sports genre.Music - Songs are good and BGM is Theri MASS!!! Hiphop Tamizha Aadhi proved once again!!!Logical Mistakes are there but Screenplay is not letting the Audience to focus on that.Also the Movie (In)directly spoke many about Tamilnadu's politics and end up with the Question on Audience.One Line about movie: Simply Superb... Congratulations Aadhi & Team!!!,4
Natpe Thunai,Please appreciate movies like this. Tamils will really love this. I dont know about other state people.,5
Natpe Thunai,Expect the unexpected....Meendum oru murai meesaiyai murukki ullar HHT Aadhi,5
Natpe Thunai,As usual sports dram film ... Amateur acting ... Pridictable story ... You want to waste your time ... Just go with it,2
Natpe Thunai,"Below review is completely based on my opinion and film knowledge.Commerical film - that's okay. But where's the entertainment?? Aadhi is going below par (considering his music and his new venture - acting & direction). This Film has all the old commercial stuff that you have seen so far in Tamil cinema. Nothing new.Bad film cast.
Bad acting.
Usual story.
Music is okay.
Bad direction.Positives to take from the movie is 'Vijay (Eruma Saani fame )' acting. Gave some good laughters to the audience.This film completely indented for making profit.I don't understand, using some good looking girls and showing them inappropriate in songs. Will that enough for you guys. Such a crap. Marketing strategy.I regret for those 3 hours.Believe me, this is not at all entertaining.This team is new & young - they should really provide quality stuff. There are more passionate, talented directors out there struggling for opportunities. One should properly utilize these kinda opportunity. I would say.",1
Natpe Thunai,"Film was really good. It was fast and had a very unique story. Usually these types of stories are really common amongst all Tamil movies, the thing that made unique was the way they presented it and how they presented it. The intermission block was awesome and really nice, it almost gave goosebumps. The music was also exceptionally good. Overall this is a really great film, this review is unbiased. Please spend your time and watch this movie with your family, it's worth it.
No one payed me any money for this good review. The movie is actually that good.",5
Natpe Thunai,"Adhi action nyc , overall movie is based on hockey....
""Here lost his friend that's really emotional""Climax scene comedy entertainment.",3
Uriyadi 2,"This script was really heart touching , climax and Bgm was awesome - every on should watch we must understand wat is reality in our state even our country situation and where going Hats off to Vijay .... we need more like this kind of movie to open up the blind eyes ( this is my first one hope might be some one read this )",5
Uriyadi 2,"One of the very few Tamil directors who handled the original script..the best political film in this decade.while some directors copying the script from other languages or country or people...vijayakumar doing the best art with the social message in his very own way.People celebrating this young director.movie is an epic and outstanding like his previous film ""Uriyadi """,5
Uriyadi 2,Don't miss it...bcz this movie msss political movie just awesome..,5
Uriyadi 2,"Movie shows the real face of Corporates, caste based politicians and spineless ruling party. Currently reflects the situation of Tuticorin incident in Tamilnadu. Although climax ended good which won't happen in real because Corporates has influence and money to buy even central boards. Some scenes took long time to complete. Otherwise Title reflects the point inside the film. Cracked and exposed everything.",5
Thadam,This movie is simply awesome. The climax is unexpected. If you don't know the story and you watch it in theatre then definitely you are sit in edge of the chair in whole movie untill the climax.,5
Thadam,"As usual ""Magizh Thirumeni"" has done a astonishing thriller genre movie second time with ""Arun Vijay"" after Thadayara Thaakka. There is no words to say about this awesome movie which made me crazy and the strong content holds the movie throughout the end.",5
Thadam,"Genre: Suspense crime thrillerNo spoiler alerts
Premise: In a murder case, police arrests civil engineer Ezhil (Arun Vijay) based on a photograph evidence. Twist comes when his look alike Kavin (again Arun Vijay), a petty but intelligent criminal, is also arrested. This makes the case stand still as there's no strong evidence against them and they don't have strong alibis. Who's the real culprit? Why do they look alike and why was the murder committed forms the plot
What worked well?
1. Tight, screenplay and sharp editing: Screenplay has no loopholes- No unwanted songs, no lengthy romance sequence, no heroism, no unnecessary comedy (barring first few mins), no guns or gadgets. The director has stuck to basic discipline i.e. screenplay and story. Simply brilliant!!!
2. Twists and turns in the movie creates an interest and you will be glued to screen. None of them are unrealistic or predictable!!!
3. Performances: It made me wonder this is an usual run of the mill story when twins looked exactly the same but you will realize it's the actual strength in the movie and much warranted. Arun Vijay is the soul of the movie and he has fully used the opportunity and is at his best!!!!
4. Director: His earlier venture with Arun Vijay was a good one and his last venture was in the lines of Departed. Both didn't get it's due recognition. It's the best among his works!!!! (Trivia: Director gave voice for Anurag Kashyap in Imaikka Nodigal)
5. It's based on real events and they quote real life judgements at the end of the movieWhat didn't work well?
1. BGM was good in parts but still could have been better.
2. There are some loophole and clues behind the suspense - trust me audiences won't even be able to think till the end of the movieI hope audience appreciate this movie given Arun Vijay is popular now. Every chance of being remade in other language if it gets due recognitionOverall, a highly entertaining classic, taut , mindblowing and outstanding suspense thriller. Must watch and Not to be missed!!!!",5
Thadam,"The narration and the thought process of the director is so unique and intriguing.
The movie keeps up on the edge even though we are able to guess certain elements in the screenplay. The songs were surprisingly quite fresh and added another dimension of emotion to the plot. On the whole Magizh Thirumeni never disappoints.",5
Thadam,"Fter thadaiyara thaaka, maeaghamann another movie with an extremely good screenplay. good luck Mr Magizh Thirumeni.",5
Thadam,"A really good movie worth the money. The Director has taken the age old concept of twins and emphasised on the similarities than differences between them to move the story forward. I really loved the making even though it could have done away from drug use. The Director has thoroughly studied loopholes in our legal system and used it for twists. You will really enjoy this experience. People who don't know Tamil, please watch it with subtitles. Best movie of the week!!! Better than Luka Chuppi!",5
Thadam,"Thadam is a gold standard 'edge of the seat' murder mystery, that's gripping from start to finish. Like the Spanish mystery 'The Invisible Guest', Thadam's biggest strength lies in its intelligent and nail biting 'thrill a minute' screenplay.Magizh Thirumeni, whom I've become a big fan of, now has 3 world class movies in his arsenal in Thadaiyara Thaakka, Meaghamann and now Thadam. Magizh T's one of the most intelligent writers of suspense/action dramas in Tamil Cinema today & I'll definitely be looking forward eagerly to see what he offers in his next movie.Arun Vjay continues to choose kickass scripts & rocks as identical twins Ezhil & Kavin. My prediction is that Thadam will be for Arun Vijay like how Ratsasan was for Vishnu Vishal. A milestone!Overall, an absolute treat for whodunit lovers. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5
Thadam,"Complete credit goes to the director and Arun viajy.I pray that Arun Vijay should choose stories like this in future since he is still struggling to get a good hold in tamil cinema.his acting in this movie shows how talented he is, People never miss this movie thats all i can say :) enjoy",5
Thadam,I didn't expect this much from this flim..... though I knew a short story it made me feel thrilled....,5
Thadam,"The story is about two people Ezhil and kavin who look alike. Ezhil is a civil engineer who lead a simple and normal life while kavin is a local intelligent criminal, who do fraudulent jobs for money. The story takes it turn when one of the look alike commits a murder. The plot of the movie is about 'who is the real murderer?' when both of them become the suspects under the police custody.
Arun vijay who played as ezhil and kavin, done a wonderful stunning performance. The story and screenplay are simply brilliant. The twist and turns are completely unpredictable eventhough the direction gives u many clues. The first half of the movie may be less engaging because u have no idea what the story is all about, But the second half of the movie is highly mindblowing and entertaining as well. Each and every single shot of the movie is perfectly made - no loopholes, no unwanted songs or scenes, no senseless comedy, the movie strictly concentrated on the story line. Every single shot of the movie is thoughtfull. Director Magizh Thirumeni done a very good job after thadaiyara thakka - really appreciatable. Songs and bgm are average other than that highly enjoyable.
I highly reccommend this movie for murder mystery lovers. Overall a must watch 'worthy classic entertaining suspense thriller movie'.",5
Thadam,Excellent Movie. Arun Vijay and everybody acted very well in the movie. The movie was so interesting and thrilling from the beginning to the end. The movie was not at all boring. Songs in the movie were not so good but the BGM in the movie was excellent. Each and every actor done their job very well. This movie is one of the best Tamil thriller movie. This is one of the best movie of Arun Vijay. Each and every scene was so interesting. The movie had an excellent story. The movie had many twists and turns which made the movie excellent. The investigation scenes were also executed in an excellent way. Even the heroines acted and used more in the movie. Excellent Movie.,5
Thadam,"You can guess the killer, you can also guess the reasonbut there's one nice twist.",4
Thadam,"Arun Vijay is on a roll especially with Thadaiyara Thaakka, Yennai Arindhaal, Kuttram 23, and Chekka Chivantha Vaanam.Thadam is one of the best thrillers from Tamil cinema that will put you to the edge of the seat. Arun Vijay of course excells in his world class acting bringing action to the film. Tanya Hope is really beautiful and her emotions are nice. Vidhya does a great job as playing a cop trying to solve this mystery. Yogi Babu is his usual self as the hero's friend and he is quite funny.
Arun Raj music really goes with the theme of this movie. The songs are average but it is actually quite decent. The BGM, however, really excels with this thriller.
Magizh Thirumeni did a great job putting this amazing thriller to action and bringing the characters to life. This is a double role never done before. The one thing that blows your mind is that this movie is based on a true story. You have to watch this movie to find out what this story is about.Thadam is one of the best movies of India of this decade. This is just a mind-blowing thriller that keeps you on the edge until the climax. This is a must watch for anyone interested in Indian cinema. Thadam is one of the highlights of Arun Vijay's career.",5
Thadam,It's the best movie i watched in tamil cinema.. I watched twice the movie and found no mismatch scene. Mr.Magizh Thirumeni Hats off to you for giving this type of awesome movies to Tamil cinema. This proves that Tamil cinema standards are becoming equal to the Hollywood movies.Keep continuing the moral pattern of this movie and we are there to support and encourage you always...,5
Thadam,What a content! Screenplay was mind blowing. Marvellous storyline. You will never get bored for a single minute. Specially ending was beyond the imagination... it's too good,5
Thadam,Be patient till the end. Got a little bit bored at some scenes. But had a good ending.,4
Thadam,"Had hooked me up to the Edge of the seat. The climax part gave me goose bumps.
The investigation and logic tied up well not completely but very well to give a very satisfied Investigatory Thriller in Tamil movies in a long time.
Had been talking about the movie for some days with friends after coming out of theater in a good way.",5
Thadam,"Let me put it straight. If you do not watch this thriller then it is a crime. Excellent screenplay and thriller. The movie will be remade in all possible languages. Each one will be hit.
The story is based on true incident. Some years back there was a case of murder where twins were involved and one of them was the murderer. This happened in Britain or somewhere in Europe. Both were released (i think so, google it).Using the one line story and making a movie out of it is simply brilliant.
Hollywood stuff...",5
Thadam,"One of the best suspense crime thriller watched once again by this movie
Climax and suspense is rocking the audience.
Hats off to the team",5
Thadam,"Finely chiselled crime thriller in recent times. Characters playing in the film are chosen wisely. As usual, Arun vijay nailed by his performance. Well done screenplay will make you bite your nail until EOF. Another trademark by the director Magizh. Do watch, this film Worth your money.",5
Thadam,A well written and executed movie. Arun Vijay's powerful performance is the star of the show. The movie is paced really well. Great build up of different layers of the story as the movie progresses. And a brilliant climax in the end makes Thadam a must watch movie. Full marks for the movie and the crew.,5
Thadam,"Its a very different crime thriller film i have seen. Character description,sharp cinematography,smart editing makes audience don't got the twist. First 40 minutes are so irritating or useless for the film.. But that 40 minutes means the whole film. I see audience they don't make a decision that what happened in climax. They're so confused. This is good point to the good director..Must watch...",5
Thadam,Awesome movie must watch thriller in Tamil New of its kind,5
Airaa,Are you a lazy person? Definitely watch this film that shows the importance of time in a horror outline. Double action by the lady superstar as well. A fairly good ghost elements make the film a family entertainer.,5
Airaa,"Wow! This was not only a great horror movie but a great movie, period! In effect it was about the ripple effect of our everyday actions. As a horror movie it was about an evil spirit and the reason she had for killing. 1st off, just the screen presence of Nayanthara was enough to like this movie. What a performance! And the construction of this movie was simply textbook. This might also be one of the best storylines for a horror movie as well. And what about the music soundtrack? It was a very integral part of the movie. It made it just that much better! Think of the soundtrack for It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(which Total Dhamaal was a remake). So the ensemble cast was perfect, the cinematography was perfect, in short, the whole movie was perfect! Don't wait another day, see this movie now!",5
Airaa,"Good efforts . Lady Super start performing well , nayantara . Expecting better ending .",5
Airaa,"A mediocre attempt at trying to mix and mash the butterfly effect and the horror genre. Your eyes will beg for reprive after watching this senseless story where characters like the granny, fat dude and babloo have been added just to fill the large glaring loopholes, who serve no actual purpose and just confuse the viewer.
Please do yourself a favor and miss this movie!",1
Airaa,At first I was so excited to watch this movie after watching it's trailer. But then I feel so disappointed because it's nothing that I expected. Nayanthara's acting is very remarkable. For sure she had come out of her safe zone. But the story lacks something. Overall it's a one time watchable movie,3
LKG,"I expected this movie to be an average one but it broke it out. It was kinda well-made movie with neat photography, catchy numbers, and strong casting. I didn't expect such a good, socially impactful writing. Being a first-time movie maker and actor, RJ Balaji definitely stands out, but I'd bet he wouldn't be able to do this again since this movie has almost talked about his personality and all about what he usually talks over & over again in his radio shows. It mostly stood out mainly because he embedded almost all of the current/nasty/funny political events in the state which already uplifted the whole meme makers' lives.",4
LKG,"Want to spend two and half hours laughing non-stop forgetting all worries and with out any party affiliations? Then you are right in choosing LKG for the weekend treat.
No star values, no big director, Music maestro to score, locations in foreign countries but if still any body can take the movie smoothly till the end does it not mean it is a great success? And RJ Balaji has passed the acid test as hero! Kudos to him!
To be frank it's not an easy joke in the present scenario. The timing is perfect as the elections are fast approaching and people are getting busy for it.
Three cheers to R.J.Balaji! And to the producer (Isari Ganesh) and director (K.R.Prabhu) too who have cast him boldly.
We have very few known faces like Priya Anand, Santhanabharati, Ramkumar, Mayilsamy, Nanjil Sampath in significan roles and Manobala in a guest role. All have done justice to their part. Another major role is political rival of Balaji,well done by Ritesh. Priya Anand has got a major role in this movie unlike other earlier movies where she will just walk as a doll heroine. Here she represents a corporate company who help in training and evolving methodology and strategies to score and win the election. Good work.
It's a political satire and comedy on the plight and journey of a starter(Balaji) , whose father is a ""failed"" politician (N Sampath) but son dreams to become chief minister from Councilor. How he utilises the opportunities or bends the situation to his advantage is the rest of story. More details will mar the interest and please watch it on the big screen.Unlike other comedies this movie does not just depend on string of continuous jokes galore but on satirical splashes and quotes which one can easily identify with persons and happenings in our political arena. No party is spared. His timing is perfect, which is very much essential for comedy.
Balaji's rise is very much welcome in the absence of good comedians now.
All other aspects like cinematography, sound, editing all are very good.
Go, enjoy with friends and family!
You won't repent.",4
LKG,"Superb political movie...
Inspiring...r.j.balaji acted so well ...brave acting . The movie is abt tge current sitiuation of politics in tn.1",5
LKG,They really wanted to tell something but it's just a failed attempt.Maybe normal audience could enjoy the movie but critically it's just a mixed inspirations from other movies of same genre.It started well.The first 30 minutes was so funny and they used many relevant matters.Then it starts to go to an ordinary level with unsatisfying story.I appreciate their effort to tell the viewers to vote properly but unfortunately the movie is not up to the marks.,2
To Let,"This is one of the few movies that will stay with you long after you have left the cinemas. Character development at it's best and each scene is very relevant to the story. The actors have done a phenomenal job especially the lead female character. The story itself is fresh and never been heard of in the past. Very natural and simple shots makes this movie stand out from rest of the mass entertainment movies. Kudos to Chezhiyan, I'm sure he is going to become extremely successful as a director.",5
To Let,"In my childhood days our family was in rented house. On those times my mom used to say to my dad that we need our own house even though its very small. Since i was small i could understand the reason behind her words but the real feelings i felt when i watched this movie. I seen it till end of the title.
My heart is filled with emotions after seeing this movie.
Thanks to all the cast and crews in the movie. You have given a wonderful wonderful movie.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel's masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just ""world domination."" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mle that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.
5 stars out of 5",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"I absolutely loved this movie. It was intense, action-packed and emotional. Also delivering comedy when needed, but it was a relatively dark film. All of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that they're superheroes. This is easily the best superhero movie ever made. Thanos is one of the best villains of the MCU, as well as one of the best of Cinematic history in general. Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos' point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling. Even driving some people to say that Thanos was right in all this. I wouldn't go that far, but I would say his character is misunderstood. Definitely a compelling villain in Thanos. The ending of the movie was insanely emotional, but I love how they (mainly) set aside the original Avengers team to take on Thanos in the fourth Avengers movie. I, for one, cannot wait.That eerie ""Thanos will return"" at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine. It truly is the end game now, and I can't wait to see the Avengers rise up and likely defeat Thanos in the next movie.+Every Hero has their moment to shine (Much like the villain wants, the movie achieves balance in this way)
+Good Comedic moments to balance (again pun intended) the dark tone of the film
+Emotional and Heavy ending (Seeing Earths Mightiest fail is something devastating to watch)
+Complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years
+Incredible performances
+Phenomenal original score 
Etc. Not much you can find that's wrong with this movie. It's literally the perfect movie Marvel has been building up to for 10 years. And those that claim it didn't have an ending as a negative, I beg to differ. Just because the villain won doesn't mean it didn't have an ending. My Rating: 10/10",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"I went and looked, and I want to express my thoughts.I went to this film with very high expectations, with a sense of something. I went to him twice, the first time, myself, and the second with the family, and I was even surprised that my mother, sister and dad (who do not understand this movie at all) brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotions.Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored, from the Marvel logo, and to the stage after the credits. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath. In comparison with the War of Infinity, even the Confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandbox.Uuuu, and the villain, the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy, he is not just a bot at once, without motivation, no, it's just the opposite. I liked Thanos so much that you do not want to, and he began to impress me, in terms of his convictions (I had it only once, with Joker Heath Ledger). He has feelings, he makes choices, he's alive.Tense scenes are beautiful, in one moment I still let off a meager male tear (and this happens to me very, very rarely). What about the humor, the jokes are correct for me, and they do not bother you like Thor: Ragnarok, although in the beginning they look a little tight. Well, the action, it is very high-quality, and in comparison with the Black Panther is generally ideal.And of course the film can not be without punctures. The lack of predictability of some story lines, and a couple of moments that were very predictable, but they are fade against the background of all this scale.Yes, you will not find anything in this film about something, something, but, what, what, what, steep humor. Thanks to Marvel and of course the Rousseau brothers, the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that I've been waiting for for 3 years.Out of 10, I give the War of Infinity 9.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable. The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them. My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it. Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves. 9.8/10",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans. The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. 
Star-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy. Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot. Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene. Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense. Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie. Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth. Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU.",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of ""everything is gonna be alright"" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I'm definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"Just WOW , The Russo nailed it, hand down from me they did it again. Part by part is interesting to watch , some of scene make me shock some scene make me wanna punch people so bad. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones. One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it.Really worth watching it , if u non Marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch , really enjoy it . Of course every good movie always have some issue with it but just MINOR issue can close eye and let it go. Going to watch it again soon . Love from Malaysia.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"There is literally no way to dislike this movie. People complain about humor. Use your brains and you will see that the humor is necessary yet high quality. There are no mistakes in any of the aspects of the movie. Some minor plot holes but thats it. it's a solid 9.5 movie. An epic journey. With more than 20+ characters Russo brothers managed to an amazing movie with that many caharacters. This is literrally the hardest movie ever in cinema history. And they succeeded amazingly. Which Zack Snyder/DC couldnt do with that terrible movie Batman V Superman. Only 2 or 3 main characters. Pathetic. Stop giving bad reviews because of humor you cant understand. infinity War is a masterpiece.Acting = Perfect 10/10
Soundtrack = Perfect 10/10
Cgi/Visuals = Perfect 10/10 (Thanos' Cgi is unique, There is no other cgi as good as it)
Story = Almost perfect 9.8/10",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10",5
Avengers: Infinity War,"In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. 
 
The day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel. After watching this movie I feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure Peter Quill is, just like they did with Danny Rand in the defenders.",4
Avengers: Infinity War,"I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular.However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly. At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before. I just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle... When it finally did end I felt cheated of the time.",2
Avengers: Infinity War,This movie Is over hyped. The title of this movie should be Infinity War Part 1 & I fail to see how another 2 hours of Thanos Barnie like skin and clam shell chin will make for good entertainment.,5
Avengers: Infinity War,"This movie was litterly the same as the avengers and civil war. Nothing new here except that the hype is getting stronger??? By rules of nature hype must die down over time but marvel fanboys want more bad movies? Disney's board of director's and their shareholders are laughing their ass off. They acquire the rights of a universe with some superheroes en then they release 5 superhero movies a year that are complete and utter trash but its fanbase will love it no matter wat. now a cgi war movie (were we all now how of how it will end, it doesn't becouse Disney will keep spitting out these movies until marvel fanboys stop going to these trash movies.) Is considerd better than movies like Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, forrest gump and Leon??? Well if this is the case than i will leave this site and never come back becouse i use this site to see if a movie is worth seeing. But if a crap movie like this is considerd to be as good as THE GODFATHER!!! then i can no longer trust this site and will de-recommend it to everyone that wants to use it for the same purpose as i did.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"Oh man...I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, and so bitterly disappointed when it was done. It might not be the dumbest story I've ever been subjected to, but it sure tried hard.First off, the CGI was magnificent. Most of the cast weren't actually there when they filmed this, and yet you believe. It all looks so real, and when you have a scene with CGI Kroot, CGI Rocket and a CGI background, and everyone looks real and has emotions, it's staggering. Absolutely hands-down the best movie I've ever seen in this regard.Now let's talk about that story. Spoilers from hereon in.Hey, how about that scene where Wong cuts off Cull Obsidian's left forearm with a portal?
Hey, what about Cull Obsidian tearing off the left forearm of the Hulkbuster suit?
How about that scene where Groot cuts off his own left forearm to form the handle of Stormbreaker?Are we seeing a pattern here? What to do about a bad guy who wears the ultimate weapon on his left forearm? Ooooh, I wonder. And Thor with that spanky new AXE and all...Not to mention the master of the time stone choosing not to use it at any time in the movie to make it all better. Yeah, yeah, yeah, halfway through he looks into the future and sees only one way to win (assertion with no evidence) but he doesn't even try earlier?Dumb. Disappointingly dumb.Fantastic dialogue throughout. Clever moves from Thanos's guys in Wakanda, and some amazing fight scenes. But that story...And the second Black Panther (with another movie in the works), Spider-Man (with another movie in the works) and the Guardians (say it with me) start to wink out, you KNOW it isn't going to stick. And Part 2 will involve some form of travelling back in time to undo it all. Good grief.",1
Avengers: Infinity War,"Film was entertaining, ive watched all marvel movies multiple times.
This film is great fun but is far to rushed, of cause with so many characters involved was always going to be a tough one to do, part 2 may improve it.Happy i saw in Imax but would def wait till on tv to watch again.
overall an entertaining but average film with lots missed, nothing special and worse than some of the stand alone movies.",3
Avengers: Infinity War,"I don't recognize the THANOS The MAD TITAN from the comic books. Thanos would NOT waste his time balancing the universe if he didn't get something out of it which was Lady Death's love. Lady Death's influence with romance makes more sense. Disney's Mickey Mouse version of Thanos was easy on the Avengers. The MAD TITAN in comics books would have not been sooo fun loving and bubbly, hilarious. Thanos motive in Disney's Mickey Mouse Avengers Infinity War movie is stupid and illogical. Mickey Mouse has turned Thanos into an EMO CRYBABY. Booo!!! Kiddie Disney ruined Avengers Infinity War which is really the Gauntlet story. DIsney can't get the titles right either. Booo! Mickey Mouse has taking over the Marvel Universe making all comic books for the kiddies kids and less for adults. Booo! Booo! 1/10 stars",0

90 ML,Only 1 song was good.Rest of the movie was garbage.,1
90 ML,Taking a huge risk I decided to tag along with a few friends of mine who assured me that the movie would be so bad that it would be good. But what unfolded before our unassuming eyes was something very different entirely. The movie is about a group of women who have issues with their love life and are secretly suffering with their earth quake like problems. Enter our messaih with decent clothes to solve these issues. It seems to me like I was stuck in a loop cause I believe I was watching the same sequence of scenes over and over again. There were some scenes that were so unbelievably bad that it made me feel a bit irked. I am not an expert but I don't think you can kidnap some one with a kitchen knife nor can a group of battle hardned gangsters be defeated by throwing large empty blue barrels at them. Having used up all our will power to stay until then we decided to leave after figuring out that the movie would only get worse. I didn't want to Know what happened at the end. You could try and let everyone know if you want. All the luck in the world to you.,0

90 ML,"The on screen debut of Oviya was widely anticipated, but the trailer was a huge let down for her vast following with a bold and ribald show of sex and alcohol. Her iconic status immediately diminished and what remained to be seen was the quality of the movie.This movie spewed a rage of Feminist taglines. In fact, it imposed and exposed Feminism in all stages but did not even once reflect the need for Feminism. It depicted Feminism as a drug taking, man hating and superimposing ideology that did not endorse a healthy marriage life. However, the Feminists appear to have embraced and celebrated the movie's release.In terms of performance of the cast, all including Oviya's acting could at best be described as contained in mediocrity. The hilarity was hardly laugh inspiring and the action was downright terrible. There was no joke without any connection to sex, and even the plot hardly led anywhere.In conclusion, 90ml was a useless movie hardly worth watching, unless you wish to see for yourself what Feminism truly stands for.",1
